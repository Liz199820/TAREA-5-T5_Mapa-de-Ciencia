TI  - Gravity-Driven Microfluidic Siphons: Fluidic Characterization and Application to 
      Quantitative Immunoassays.
PG  - 4338-4348
LID - 10.1021/acssensors.1c01524 [doi]
AB  - A range of biosensing techniques including immunoassays are routinely used for 
      quantitation of analytes in biological samples and available in a range of formats, 
      from centralized lab testing (e.g., microplate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
      (ELISA)) to automated point-of-care (POC) and lateral flow immunochromatographic 
      tests. High analytical performance is intrinsically linked to the use of a sequence 
      of reagent and washing steps, yet this is extremely challenging to deliver at the 
      POC without a high level of fluidic control involving, e.g., automation, fluidic 
      pumping, or manual fluid handling/pipetting. Here we introduce a microfluidic siphon 
      concept that conceptualizes a multistep ″dipstick″ for quantitative, enzymatically 
      amplified immunoassays using a strip of microporous or microbored material. We 
      demonstrated that gravity-driven siphon flow can be realized in single-bore glass 
      capillaries, a multibored microcapillary film, and a glass fiber porous membrane. In 
      contrast to other POC devices proposed to date, the operation of the siphon is only 
      dependent on the hydrostatic liquid pressure (gravity) and not capillary forces, and 
      the unique stepwise approach to the delivery of the sample and immunoassay reagents 
      results in zero dead volume in the device, no reagent overlap or carryover, and full 
      start/stop fluid control. We demonstrated applications of a 10-bore microfluidic 
      siphon as a portable ELISA system without compromised quantitative capabilities in 
      two global diagnostic applications: (1) a four-plex sandwich ELISA for rapid 
      smartphone dengue serotype identification by serotype-specific dengue virus NS1 
      antigen detection, relevant for acute dengue fever diagnosis, and (2) quantitation 
      of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM titers in spiked serum samples. Diagnostic siphons 
      provide the opportunity for high-performance immunoassay testing outside 
      sophisticated laboratories, meeting the rapidly changing global clinical and public 
      health needs.

TI  - A gravity-driven sintering method to fabricate geometrically complex compact 
      piezoceramics.

AB  - Highly compact and geometrically complex piezoceramics are required by a variety of 
      electromechanical devices owing to their outstanding piezoelectricity, mechanical 
      stability and extended application scenarios. 3D printing is currently the 
      mainstream technology for fabricating geometrically complex piezoceramic components. 
      However, it is hard to print piezoceramics in a curve shape while also keeping its 
      compactness due to restrictions on the ceramic loading and the viscosity of 
      feedstocks. Here, we report a gravity-driven sintering (GDS) process to directly 
      fabricate curved and compact piezoceramics by exploiting gravitational force and 
      high-temperature viscous behavior of sintering ceramic specimens. The sintered lead 
      zirconate titanate (PZT) ceramics possess curve geometries that can be facilely 
      tuned via the initial mechanical boundary design, and exhibit high piezoelectric 
      properties comparable to those of conventional-sintered compact PZT (d(33) = 595 
      pC/N). In contrast to 3D printing technology, our GDS process is suitable for 
      scale-up production and low-cost production of piezoceramics with diverse curved 
      surfaces. Our GDS strategy is an universal and facile route to fabricate curved 
      piezoceramics and other functional ceramics with no compromise of their 
      functionalities.

AB  - This investigation describes the hydromagnetic flow of gravity-driven couple stress 
      hybrid nanofluid past a heated plate. The carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are used to 
      characterize the hybrid nanofluid. The heated plate is placed vertically with an 
      application of homogenous-heterogeneous reactions to the assumed flow system. The 
      homogeneous reaction governs by isothermal cubic autocatalytic kinetics while the 
      heterogeneous reaction governs by the first order kinetics. For current study the 
      couple stress hybrid nanofluid is presumed to be conducted electrically with impact 
      of non-uniform magnetic effects. An appropriate set of dimensionless quantities has 
      employed to governing equations and then has solved by homotopy analysis method. The 
      influence of emerging parameters encountered in this work has discussed in detail 
      with the help of graphs. In this study it has examined that, flow of fluid reduces 
      with upsurge in magnetic parameter and volumetric concentrations, whereas thermal 
      and concentration characteristics augment with increase in volumetric 
      concentrations. Moreover, growth in Prandtl number leads to a reduction in thermal 
      characteristics and growth in Schmidt number result a reduction in concentration 
      profile. The impact of various emerging parameters has also studied numerically upon 
      physical quantities. It has established that, with augmentation in values of 
      buoyancy parameter there is a growth in the values of skin friction. A comparison 
      has also carried out between current and established results with a fine agreement 
      in both results.

LID - 457
AB  - Porous Al(2)O(3) membranes were prepared through a phase-inversion tape 
      casting/sintering method. The alumina membranes were embedded with finger-like pores 
      perpendicular to the membrane surface. Bare alumina membranes are naturally 
      hydrophilic and underwater oleophobic, while fluoroalkylsilane (FAS)-grafted 
      membranes are hydrophobic and oleophilic. The coupling of FAS molecules on alumina 
      surfaces was confirmed by Thermogravimetric Analysis and X-ray Photoelectron 
      Spectroscopy measurements. The hydrophobic membranes exhibited desired thermal 
      stability and were super durable when exposed to air. Both membranes can be used for 
      gravity-driven oil/water separation, which is highly cost-effective. The 
      as-calculated separation efficiency (R) was above 99% for the FAS-grafted alumina 
      membrane. Due to the excellent oil/water separation performance and good chemical 
      stability, the porous ceramic membranes display potential for practical 
      applications.

LID - 151
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pollution - unwanted waste released to air, water, and land by human 
      activity - is the largest environmental cause of disease in the world today. It is 
      responsible for an estimated nine million premature deaths per year, enormous 
      economic losses, erosion of human capital, and degradation of ecosystems. Ocean 
      pollution is an important, but insufficiently recognized and inadequately controlled 
      component of global pollution. It poses serious threats to human health and 
      well-being. The nature and magnitude of these impacts are only beginning to be 
      understood. GOALS: (1) Broadly examine the known and potential impacts of ocean 
      pollution on human health. (2) Inform policy makers, government leaders, 
      international organizations, civil society, and the global public of these threats. 
      (3) Propose priorities for interventions to control and prevent pollution of the 
      seas and safeguard human health. METHODS: Topic-focused reviews that examine the 
      effects of ocean pollution on human health, identify gaps in knowledge, project 
      future trends, and offer evidence-based guidance for effective intervention. 
      ENVIRONMENTAL FINDINGS: Pollution of the oceans is widespread, worsening, and in 
      most countries poorly controlled. It is a complex mixture of toxic metals, plastics, 
      manufactured chemicals, petroleum, urban and industrial wastes, pesticides, 
      fertilizers, pharmaceutical chemicals, agricultural runoff, and sewage. More than 
      80% arises from land-based sources. It reaches the oceans through rivers, runoff, 
      atmospheric deposition and direct discharges. It is often heaviest near the coasts 
      and most highly concentrated along the coasts of low- and middle-income countries. 
      Plastic is a rapidly increasing and highly visible component of ocean pollution, and 
      an estimated 10 million metric tons of plastic waste enter the seas each year. 
      Mercury is the metal pollutant of greatest concern in the oceans; it is released 
      from two main sources - coal combustion and small-scale gold mining. Global spread 
      of industrialized agriculture with increasing use of chemical fertilizer leads to 
      extension of Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) to previously unaffected regions. Chemical 
      pollutants are ubiquitous and contaminate seas and marine organisms from the high 
      Arctic to the abyssal depths. ECOSYSTEM FINDINGS: Ocean pollution has multiple 
      negative impacts on marine ecosystems, and these impacts are exacerbated by global 
      climate change. Petroleum-based pollutants reduce photosynthesis in marine 
      microorganisms that generate oxygen. Increasing absorption of carbon dioxide into 
      the seas causes ocean acidification, which destroys coral reefs, impairs shellfish 
      development, dissolves calcium-containing microorganisms at the base of the marine 
      food web, and increases the toxicity of some pollutants. Plastic pollution threatens 
      marine mammals, fish, and seabirds and accumulates in large mid-ocean gyres. It 
      breaks down into microplastic and nanoplastic particles containing multiple 
      manufactured chemicals that can enter the tissues of marine organisms, including 
      species consumed by humans. Industrial releases, runoff, and sewage increase 
      frequency and severity of HABs, bacterial pollution, and anti-microbial resistance. 
      Pollution and sea surface warming are triggering poleward migration of dangerous 
      pathogens such as the Vibrio species. Industrial discharges, pharmaceutical wastes, 
      pesticides, and sewage contribute to global declines in fish stocks. HUMAN HEALTH 
      FINDINGS: Methylmercury and PCBs are the ocean pollutants whose human health effects 
      are best understood. Exposures of infants in utero to these pollutants through 
      maternal consumption of contaminated seafood can damage developing brains, reduce IQ 
      and increase children's risks for autism, ADHD and learning disorders. Adult 
      exposures to methylmercury increase risks for cardiovascular disease and dementia. 
      Manufactured chemicals - phthalates, bisphenol A, flame retardants, and 
      perfluorinated chemicals, many of them released into the seas from plastic waste - 
      can disrupt endocrine signaling, reduce male fertility, damage the nervous system, 
      and increase risk of cancer. HABs produce potent toxins that accumulate in fish and 
      shellfish. When ingested, these toxins can cause severe neurological impairment and 
      rapid death. HAB toxins can also become airborne and cause respiratory disease. 
      Pathogenic marine bacteria cause gastrointestinal diseases and deep wound 
      infections. With climate change and increasing pollution, risk is high that Vibrio 
      infections, including cholera, will increase in frequency and extend to new areas. 
      All of the health impacts of ocean pollution fall disproportionately on vulnerable 
      populations in the Global South - environmental injustice on a planetary scale. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Ocean pollution is a global problem. It arises from multiple sources 
      and crosses national boundaries. It is the consequence of reckless, shortsighted, 
      and unsustainable exploitation of the earth's resources. It endangers marine 
      ecosystems. It impedes the production of atmospheric oxygen. Its threats to human 
      health are great and growing, but still incompletely understood. Its economic costs 
      are only beginning to be counted.Ocean pollution can be prevented. Like all forms of 
      pollution, ocean pollution can be controlled by deploying data-driven strategies 
      based on law, policy, technology, and enforcement that target priority pollution 
      sources. Many countries have used these tools to control air and water pollution and 
      are now applying them to ocean pollution. Successes achieved to date demonstrate 
      that broader control is feasible. Heavily polluted harbors have been cleaned, 
      estuaries rejuvenated, and coral reefs restored.Prevention of ocean pollution 
      creates many benefits. It boosts economies, increases tourism, helps restore 
      fisheries, and improves human health and well-being. It advances the Sustainable 
      Development Goals (SDG). These benefits will last for centuries. RECOMMENDATIONS: 
      World leaders who recognize the gravity of ocean pollution, acknowledge its growing 
      dangers, engage civil society and the global public, and take bold, evidence-based 
      action to stop pollution at source will be critical to preventing ocean pollution 
      and safeguarding human health.Prevention of pollution from land-based sources is 
      key. Eliminating coal combustion and banning all uses of mercury will reduce mercury 
      pollution. Bans on single-use plastic and better management of plastic waste reduce 
      plastic pollution. Bans on persistent organic pollutants (POPs) have reduced 
      pollution by PCBs and DDT. Control of industrial discharges, treatment of sewage, 
      and reduced applications of fertilizers have mitigated coastal pollution and are 
      reducing frequency of HABs. National, regional and international marine pollution 
      control programs that are adequately funded and backed by strong enforcement have 
      been shown to be effective. Robust monitoring is essential to track progress.Further 
      interventions that hold great promise include wide-scale transition to renewable 
      fuels; transition to a circular economy that creates little waste and focuses on 
      equity rather than on endless growth; embracing the principles of green chemistry; 
      and building scientific capacity in all countries.Designation of Marine Protected 
      Areas (MPAs) will safeguard critical ecosystems, protect vulnerable fish stocks, and 
      enhance human health and well-being. Creation of MPAs is an important manifestation 
      of national and international commitment to protecting the health of the seas.

AB  - Rapid nucleic acid testing is a critical component of a robust infrastructure for 
      increased disease surveillance. Here, we report a microfluidic platform for 
      point-of-care, CRISPR-based molecular diagnostics. We first developed a nucleic acid 
      test which pairs distinct mechanisms of DNA and RNA amplification optimized for high 
      sensitivity and rapid kinetics, linked to Cas13 detection for specificity. We 
      combined this workflow with an extraction-free sample lysis protocol using 
      shelf-stable reagents that are widely available at low cost, and a multiplexed human 
      gene control for calling negative test results. As a proof-of-concept, we 
      demonstrate sensitivity down to 40 copies/μL of SARS-CoV-2 in unextracted saliva 
      within 35 minutes, and validated the test on total RNA extracted from patient nasal 
      swabs with a range of qPCR Ct values from 13-35. To enable sample-to-answer testing, 
      we integrated this diagnostic reaction with a single-use, gravity-driven 
      microfluidic cartridge followed by real-time fluorescent detection in a compact 
      companion instrument. We envision this approach for Diagnostics with Coronavirus 
      Enzymatic Reporting (DISCoVER) will incentivize frequent, fast, and easy testing.

AB  - A discrete model is proposed for settling of an arbitrary-shaped particle onto a 
      flat surface under the gravitational field. In this method, the particle dynamics is 
      calculated such that (a) the particle does not create an overlap with the wall and 
      (b) reaches a realistic equilibrium state, which are not guaranteed in the 
      conventional discrete element methods that add a repulsive force (torque) based on 
      the amount of overlap between the particle and the wall. Instead, upon the detection 
      of collision, the particle's kinematics is modified depending on the type of 
      contact, i.e., point, line, and surface types, by assuming the contact point/line as 
      the instantaneous center/line of rotation for calculating the rigid body dynamics. 
      Two different stability conditions are implemented by comparing the location of the 
      projection of the center of mass on the wall along gravity direction against the 
      contact points to identify the equilibrium (stable) state on the wall for particles 
      with multiple contact points. A variety of simulations are presented, including 
      smooth surface particles (ellipsoids), regular particles with sharp edges (cylinders 
      and pyramids) and irregular-shaped particles, to show that the method can provide 
      the analytically-known equilibrium state.

TI  - Data-Driven Proxy Model for Forecasting of Cumulative Oil Production during the 
      Steam-Assisted Gravity Drainage Process.
PG  - 11497-11509
LID - 10.1021/acsomega.1c00617 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this study is to develop a data-driven proxy model for forecasting of 
      cumulative oil (Cum-oil) production during the steam-assisted gravity drainage 
      process. During the model building process, an artificial neural network (ANN) is 
      used to offer a complementary and computationally efficient tool for the 
      physics-driven model, and the von Bertalanffy performance indicator is used to 
      bridge the physics-driven model with the ANN. After that, the accuracy of the model 
      is validated by blind-testing cases. Average absolute percentage error of related 
      parameters of the performance indicator in the testing data set is 0.77%, and the 
      error of Cum-oil production after 20 years is 0.52%. The results illustrate that the 
      integration of performance indicator and ANN makes it possible to solve time series 
      problems in an efficient way. Besides, the data-driven proxy model could be applied 
      to fast parametric studies, quick uncertainty analysis with the Monte Carlo method, 
      and average daily oil production prediction. The findings of this study could help 
      for better understanding of combination of physics-driven model and data-driven 
      model and illustrate the potential for application of the data-driven proxy model to 
      help reservoir engineers, making better use of this significant thermal recovery 
      technology for oil sands or heavy oil reservoirs.

TI  - Gravity-Driven Membrane Reactor for Decentralized Wastewater Treatment: Effect of 
      Reactor Configuration and Cleaning Protocol.
LID - 10.3390/membranes11060388 [doi]
LID - 388
AB  - In this study, three gravity-driven membrane (GDM) reactors with flat sheet membrane 
      modules and various biocarriers (synthetic fibers, lava stones, and sands) were 
      operated for municipal wastewater treatment. The effects of water head, periodically 
      cleaning protocol, and operation temperature on the GDM reactor performance were 
      illustrated in terms of membrane performance and water quality. The results 
      indicated that: (1) the cake layer fouling was predominant (>~85%), regardless of 
      reactor configuration and operation conditions; (2) under lower water head, variable 
      water head benefited in achieving higher permeate fluxes due to effective relaxation 
      of the compacted cake layers; (3) the short-term chemical cleaning (30-60 min per 
      3-4 days) improved membrane performance, especially when additional physical shear 
      force was implemented; (4) the lower temperature had negligible effect on the GDM 
      reactors packed with Icelandic lava stones and sands. Furthermore, the wastewater 
      treatment costs of the three GDM reactors were estimated, ranging between 0.31 and 
      0.37 EUR/m(3), which was greatly lower than that of conventional membrane 
      bioreactors under lower population scenarios. This sheds light on the technical and 
      economic feasibility of biocarrier-facilitated GDM systems for decentralized 
      wastewater treatment in Iceland.

TI  - Sustainable, Highly Efficient and Superhydrophobic Fluorinated Silica Functionalized 
      Chitosan Aerogel for Gravity-Driven Oil/Water Separation.
LID - 10.3390/gels7020066 [doi]
LID - 66
AB  - A superhydrophobic fluorinated silica functionalized chitosan (F-CS) aerogel is 
      constructed and fabricated by a simple and sustainable method in this study in order 
      to achieve highly efficient gravity-driven oil/water separation performance. The 
      fluorinated silica functionalization invests the pristine hydrophilic chitosan (CS) 
      aerogel with promising superhydrophobicity with a water contact angle of 151.9°. 
      This novel F-CS aerogel possesses three-dimensional structure with high porosity as 
      well as good chemical stability and mechanical compression property. Moreover, it 
      also shows striking self-cleaning performance and great oil adsorption capacity. 
      Most importantly, the as-prepared aerogels exhibits fast and efficient separation of 
      oil/water mixture by the gravity driven process with high separation efficiency. 
      These great performances render the prepared F-CS aerogel a good candidate for 
      oil/water separation in practical industrial application.

TI  - One-Cell Metabolic Phenotyping and Sequencing of Soil Microbiome by Raman-Activated 
      Gravity-Driven Encapsulation (RAGE).
PG  - e0018121
LID - 10.1128/mSystems.00181-21 [doi]
LID - e00181-21
AB  - Soil harbors arguably the most metabolically and genetically heterogeneous 
      microbiomes on Earth, yet establishing the link between metabolic functions and 
      genome at the precisely one-cell level has been difficult. Here, for mock microbial 
      communities and then for soil microbiota, we established a Raman-activated 
      gravity-driven single-cell encapsulation and sequencing (RAGE-Seq) platform, which 
      identifies, sorts, and sequences precisely one bacterial cell via its anabolic 
      (incorporating D from heavy water) and physiological (carotenoid-containing) 
      functions. We showed that (i) metabolically active cells from numerically rare soil 
      taxa, such as Corynebacterium spp., Clostridium spp., Moraxella spp., Pantoea spp., 
      and Pseudomonas spp., can be readily identified and sorted based on D(2)O uptake, 
      and their one-cell genome coverage can reach ∼93% to allow high-quality genome-wide 
      metabolic reconstruction; (ii) similarly, carotenoid-containing cells such as 
      Pantoea spp., Legionella spp., Massilia spp., Pseudomonas spp., and Pedobacter spp. 
      were identified and one-cell genomes were generated for tracing the 
      carotenoid-synthetic pathways; and (iii) carotenoid-producing cells can be either 
      metabolically active or inert, suggesting culture-based approaches can miss many 
      such cells. As a Raman-activated cell sorter (RACS) family member that can establish 
      a metabolism-genome link at exactly one-cell resolution from soil, RAGE-Seq can help 
      to precisely pinpoint "who is doing what" in complex ecosystems. IMPORTANCE Soil is 
      home to an enormous and complex microbiome that features arguably the highest 
      genomic diversity and metabolic heterogeneity of cells on Earth. Their in situ 
      metabolic activities drive many natural processes of pivotal ecological significance 
      or underlie industrial production of numerous valuable bioactivities. However, 
      pinpointing "who is doing what" in a soil microbiome, which consists of mainly 
      yet-to-be-cultured species, has remained a major challenge. Here, for soil 
      microbiota, we established a Raman-activated gravity-driven single-cell 
      encapsulation and sequencing (RAGE-Seq) method, which identifies, sorts, and 
      sequences at the resolution of precisely one microbial cell via its catabolic and 
      anabolic functions. As a Raman-activated cell sorter (RACS) family member that can 
      establish a metabolism-genome link at one-cell resolution from soil, RAGE-Seq can 
      help to precisely pinpoint "who is doing what" in complex ecosystems.

LID - e0247712
AB  - In this paper we apply a gravity framework to user-generated data of a large online 
      housing market platform. We show that gravity describes the patterns of inflow and 
      outflow of hits (mouse clicks, etc.) from one municipality to another, where the 
      municipality of the user defines the origin and the municipality of the property 
      that is viewed defines the destination. By distinguishing serious searchers from 
      recreational searchers we demonstrate that the gravity framework describes 
      geographic search patterns of both types of users. The results indicate that 
      recreational search is centered more around the user's location than serious search. 
      However, this finding is driven entirely by differences in border effects as there 
      is no difference in the distance effect. By demonstrating that geographic search 
      patterns of both serious and recreational searchers are explained by their physical 
      locations, we present clear evidence that physical location is an important 
      determinant of economic behavior in the virtual realm too.

TI  - Gravity-driven microfluidic particle sorting device with hydrodynamic separation 
      amplification.
PG  - 1369-76
AB  - This paper describes a simple microfluidic sorting system that can perform size 
      profiling and continuous mass-dependent separation of particles through combined use 
      of gravity (1 g) and hydrodynamic flows capable of rapidly amplifying 
      sedimentation-based separation between particles. Operation of the device relies on 
      two microfluidic transport processes: (i) initial hydrodynamic focusing of particles 
      in a microchannel oriented parallel to gravity and (ii) subsequent sample separation 
      where positional difference between particles with different mass generated by 
      sedimentation is further amplified by hydrodynamic flows whose streamlines gradually 
      widen out due to the geometry of a widening microchannel oriented perpendicular to 
      gravity. The microfluidic sorting device was fabricated in poly(dimethylsiloxane), 
      and hydrodynamic flows in microchannels were driven by gravity without using 
      external pumps. We conducted theoretical and experimental studies on fluid dynamic 
      characteristics of laminar flows in widening microchannels and hydrodynamic 
      amplification of particle separation. Direct trajectory monitoring, collection, and 
      post-analysis of separated particles were performed using polystyrene microbeads 
      with different sizes to demonstrate rapid (<1 min) and high-purity (>99.9%) 
      separation. Finally, we demonstrated biomedical applications of our system by 
      isolating small-sized (diameter <6 microm) perfluorocarbon liquid droplets from 
      polydisperse droplet emulsions, which is crucial in preparing contrast agents for 
      safe, reliable ultrasound medical imaging, tracers for magnetic resonance imaging, 
      or transpulmonary droplets used in ultrasound-based occlusion therapy for cancer 
      treatment. Our method enables straightforward, rapid, real-time size monitoring and 
      continuous separation of particles in simple stand-alone microfabricated devices 
      without the need for bulky and complex external power sources. We believe that this 
      system will provide a useful tool to separate colloids and particles for various 
      analytical and preparative applications and may hold potential for separation of 
      cells or development of diagnostic tools requiring point-of-care sample preparation 
      or testing.

TI  - Dynamics of microbial community and their effects on membrane fouling in an 
      anoxic-oxic gravity-driven membrane bioreactor under varying solid retention time: A 
      pilot-scale study.

AB  - Membrane fouling in a membrane bioreactor (MBR) is highly influenced by the 
      characteristics of the influent, the mixed liquor microbial community and the 
      operational parameters, all of which are environment specific. Therefore, we studied 
      the dynamics of microbial community during the treatment of real municipal 
      wastewater in a pilotscale anoxic-oxic (A/O) MBR equipped with a gravity-driven 
      membrane filtration system. The MBR was operated at three different solid retention 
      times (SRTs): 25, 40 and 10 days for a total period of 180 days in Nordic 
      environmental conditions. Analysis of microbial community dynamics revealed a high 
      diversity of microbial species at SRT of 40 days, whereas SRT of 25 days was 
      superior with microbial richness. Production of soluble microbial products (SMP) and 
      extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) was found to be intensely connected with 
      the SRT and food to microorganism (F/M) ratio. Relatively longer operational period 
      with the lowest rate of membrane fouling was observed at SRT of 25 days, which was 
      resulted from the superior microbial community, lowest production of SMP and loosely 
      bound EPS as well as the lower filtration resistance of larger sludge flocs. 
      Abundance of quorum quenching (QQ) bacteria and granular floc forming bacterial 
      genera at SRT of 25 days provided relatively lower membrane fouling tendency and 
      larger floc formation, respectively. On the other hand, substantial amount of 
      various surface colonizing and EPS producing bacteria was found at SRT of 10 days, 
      which promoted more rapid membrane fouling compared with the fouling rate seen at 
      other tested SRTs. To sum up, this research provides a realistic insight into the 
      impact of SRT on microbial community dynamics and resulting characteristics of mixed 
      liquor, floc size distribution and membrane fouling for improved MBR operation.

AB  - As we go about our everyday activities, our brain computes accurate estimates of 
      both our motion relative to the world and our orientation relative to gravity. 
      However, how the brain then accounts for gravity as we actively move and interact 
      with our environment is not yet known. Here, we provide evidence that, although 
      during passive movements, individual cerebellar output neurons encode 
      representations of head motion and orientation relative to gravity, these 
      gravity-driven responses are cancelled when head movement is a consequence of 
      voluntary generated movement. In contrast, the gravity-driven responses of primary 
      otolith and semicircular canal afferents remain intact during both active and 
      passive self-motion, indicating the attenuated responses of central neurons are not 
      inherited from afferent inputs. Taken together, our results are consistent with the 
      view that the cerebellum builds a dynamic prediction (e.g., internal model) of the 
      sensory consequences of gravity during active self-motion, which in turn enables the 
      preferential encoding of unexpected motion to ensure postural and perceptual 
      stability.

TI  - Re-endothelialization of rat lung scaffolds through passive, gravity-driven seeding 
      of segment-specific pulmonary endothelial cells.
PG  - e786-e806
LID - 10.1002/term.2382 [doi]
AB  - Effective re-endothelialization is critical for the use of decellularized scaffolds 
      for ex vivo lung engineering. Current approaches yield insufficiently 
      re-endothelialized scaffolds that haemorrhage and become thrombogenic upon 
      implantation. Herein, gravity-driven seeding coupled with bioreactor culture 
      facilitated widespread distribution and engraftment of endothelial cells throughout 
      rat lung scaffolds. Initially, human umbilical vein endothelial cells were seeded 
      into the pulmonary artery by either gravity-driven, variable flow perfusion seeding 
      or pump-driven, pulsatile flow perfusion seeding. Gravity seeding evenly distributed 
      cells and supported cell survival and re-lining of the vascular walls while 
      perfusion pump-driven seeding led to increased cell fragmentation and death. Using 
      gravity seeding, rat pulmonary artery endothelial cells and rat pulmonary vein 
      endothelial cells attached in intermediate and large vessels, while rat pulmonary 
      microvascular endothelial cells deposited mostly in microvessels. Combination 
      seeding of these cells led to positive vascular endothelial cadherin staining. In 
      addition, combination seeding improved barrier function as assessed by serum albumin 
      extravasation; however, leakage was observed in the distal portions of the 
      re-endothelialized tissue suggesting that recellularization of the alveoli is 
      necessary to complete barrier function of the capillary-alveolar network. Overall, 
      these data indicate that vascular recellularization of rat lung scaffolds is 
      achieved through gravity seeding. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The space environment consists of a complex mixture of different types of ionizing 
      radiation and altered gravity that represents a threat to humans during space 
      missions. In particular, individual radiation sensitivity is strictly related to the 
      risk of space radiation carcinogenesis. Therefore, in view of future missions to the 
      Moon and Mars, there is an urgent need to estimate as accurately as possible the 
      individual risk from space exposure to improve the safety of space exploration. In 
      this review, we survey the combined effects from the two main physical components of 
      the space environment, ionizing radiation and microgravity, to alter the genetics 
      and epigenetics of human cells, considering both real and simulated space 
      conditions. Data collected from studies on human cells are discussed for their 
      potential use to estimate individual radiation carcinogenesis risk from space 
      exposure.

AB  - We present a system capable of providing visual feedback for ergometer training, 
      allowing detailed analysis and gamification. The presented solution can easily 
      upgrade any existing ergometer device. The system consists of a set of pedals with 
      embedded sensors, readout electronics and wireless communication modules and a 
      tablet device for interaction with the users, which can be mounted on any ergometer, 
      transforming it into a full analytical assessment tool with interactive training 
      capabilities. The methods to capture the forces and moments applied to the pedal, as 
      well as the pedal's angular position, were validated using reference sensors and 
      high-speed video capture systems. The mean-absolute error (MAE) for load is found to 
      be 18.82 N, 25.35 N, 0.153 Nm for Fx, Fz and Mx respectively and the MAE for the 
      pedal angle is 13.2°. A fully gamified experience of ergometer training has been 
      demonstrated with the presented system to enhance the rehabilitation experience with 
      audio visual feedback, based on measured cycling parameters.

AB  - The implementation of centralized drinking water treatment systems necessitates 
      lower operational costs and improved biopolymer removal during ultrafiltration (UF), 
      which can be afforded by gravity-driven membrane (GDM) filtration. However, prior to 
      implementing GDM filtration in centralized systems, biofilm growth in compacted 
      membrane configurations, such as inside-out hollow fiber (HF), and its impact on 
      permeate flux need to be investigated. To this end, we operated modules with 
      distinct limits on available space for biofilm growth: (1) outside-in 1.5 mm 
      7-capillary HF (non-limited), (2) inside-out 1.5 mm 7-capillary HF (limited), and 
      (3) inside-out 0.9 mm 7-capillary HF (very limited). Here, we observed that the 
      lower the space available for biofilm growth, the lower the permeate flux. To 
      improve GDM performance with inside-out HF, we applied daily shear stress to the 
      biofilm surface with forward flush (FF) or combined relaxation and forward flush 
      (R+FF). We showed that applying shear stress to the biofilm surface was insufficient 
      for controlling flux loss due to low available space for biofilm growth. At the 
      experimental endpoint, we backwashed with a stepwise transmembrane pressure (TMP) 
      increase or a single TMP on all inside-out HF modules, which removed the biofilm 
      from its base. Afterwards, higher fluxes were yielded. We also showed that all 
      modules exhibited a gradual increase in biopolymer removal followed by stabilization 
      between 70 and 90%. Additionally, control of biofilm growth with surface shear 
      stress did not affect biopolymer removal. In summary, the implementation of 
      inside-out HF with GDM filtration is challenged by low available space for biofilm 
      growth, but may be remedied with a regular backwash to remove biofilm from its base. 
      We showed that a wider range of GDM applications are available; making GDM 
      potentially compatible with implementation in centralized systems, if space 
      limitation is taken into consideration for operation optimization.

TI  - An Automated, Gravity-driven CSF Drainage System Decreases Complications and Lowers 
      Costs.

LID - e1009
AB  - BACKGROUND: FlowSafe(TM) (BeckerSmith Medical, Irvine, CA, USA) is a novel, robotic, 
      external lumbar drainage (ELD) system, which was designed to control cerebrospinal 
      fluid (CSF) drainage, reduce complications, and decrease treatment costs. METHODS: 
       Forty-seven consecutive neurosurgical patients requiring ELD were treated using the 
      FlowSafe system. RESULTS: In 39 of 40 patients with traumatic and surgical dural 
      openings, potential CSF leaks were avoided. In seven patients with suspected normal 
      pressure hydrocephalus, post-infectious ventriculomegaly, or pseudotumor cerebrum, 
      we were able to assess the likelihood of improvement with shunting. The system, 
      therefore, produced what we considered to be the "desired result" in 46 of 47 
      patients (98%). Our one treatment failure (2%) involved a patient with unrecognized 
      hydrocephalus who, following a Chiari repair with a dural patch graft, was drained 
      for six days. A persistent CSF leak eventually required a reoperation. Two patients 
      (4%) described low-pressure headaches during treatment. Both responded to 
      temporarily suspending or reducing the drainage rate. We saw no 
      complications. Required nursing interventions were minimal.  Conclusions: The 
      FlowSafe system was safe and effective. In our experience, there were fewer 
      complications compared to currently available ELD systems. The FlowSafe was well 
      tolerated by our patients. The near elimination of nursing interventions should 
      allow lumbar drainage to be delivered in less costly, non-intensive care unit 
      settings. Larger trials will be needed.

LID - e111794
AB  - Gravity-driven membrane (GDM) ultrafiltration systems require little maintenance: 
      they operate without electricity at ultra-low pressure in dead-end mode and without 
      control of the biofilm formation. These systems are already in use for water 
      purification in some regions of the world where adequate treatment and distribution 
      of drinking water is not readily available. However, many water bodies worldwide 
      exhibit harmful blooms of cyanobacteria that severely lower the water quality due to 
      the production of toxic microcystins (MCs). We studied the performance of a GDM 
      system during an artificial Microcystis aeruginosa bloom in lake water and its 
      simulated collapse (i.e., the massive release of microcystins) over a period of 21 
      days. Presence of live or destroyed cyanobacterial cells in the feed water decreased 
      the permeate flux in the Microcystis treatments considerably. At the same time, the 
      microbial biofilms on the filter membranes could successfully reduce the amount of 
      microcystins in the filtrate below the critical threshold concentration of 1 µg 
      L(-1) MC for human consumption in three out of four replicates after 15 days. We 
      found pronounced differences in the composition of bacterial communities of the 
      biofilms on the filter membranes. Bacterial genera that could be related to 
      microcystin degradation substantially enriched in the biofilms amended with 
      microcystin-containing cyanobacteria. In addition to bacteria previously 
      characterized as microcystin degraders, members of other bacterial clades 
      potentially involved in MC degradation could be identified.

AB  - We report a facile method for preparing silver-loaded membranes for point-of-use 
      disinfection and disaster relief applications. A bio-inspired material, 
      polydopamine, was coated onto a highly porous nanofibrous polyacrylonitrile 
      substrate. We then take advantage of the redox properties of polydopamine to form 
      silver nanoparticles in situ. These nanoparticles were uniformly distributed on the 
      surface of nanofibers with no apparent agglomeration at a silver loading up to 
      4.36 wt.% (cPAN-Ag1.5). The silver-incorporated membrane cPAN-Ag1.5 achieved a high 
      pure water flux of 130 Lm(-2) h(-1) at 10-cm water head, demonstrating the 
      feasibility of energy-efficient gravity-driven filtration and eliminating the need 
      for electrical power. The strong anti-bacterial activity and high physical rejection 
      of the membrane led to an excellent disinfection power, with no viable bacterial 
      cells detected in its permeate water. The membrane exhibited >7 log reduction for E. 
      coli and >6 log reduction for B. subtilis. The strategy reported here provides an 
      efficient and green route to synthesize point-of-use membranes. Combining their 
      excellent permeability and disinfection effectiveness, these membranes offer an 
      ideal solution to water supply in disaster-affected areas.

AB  - Achieving oscillatory motion in polymers without requiring on/off switching of 
      stimuli is a current challenge. Hereby, a free-standing liquid crystal polymer (LCP) 
      is demonstrated to undergo a sustained oscillatory motion when triggered by light, 
      moving back and forth, resembling the motion of a rocking-chair. Two polymer films 
      having different azobenzene photo-switches have been studied, revealing photoswitch 
      requirements as well as illumination conditions necessary to sustain oscillations. 
      The motion presented here shows how feedback loops involving light-triggered 
      actuation, self-shadowing and a shifting center of gravity can be utilized to 
      achieve self-sustained motion in free-standing polymers.

AB  - Immunoassays are critical for clinical diagnostics and biomedical research. However, 
      two major challenges remaining in conventional immunoassays are precise 
      quantification and development of immunoassays for small-molecule detection. Here, a 
      two signal-mode small-molecule immunoassay containing an internal reference that 
      provides high stability and reproducibility compared to conventional small-molecule 
      immunoassays is presented. A system is developed for quantitative monitoring of the 
      digoxin concentration in plasma in the clinically relevant range (0.6-2.6 nm). 
      Furthermore, the model system is integrated into a simple gravity-driven 
      microfluidic chip (G-Chip) requiring only 10 µL plasma. The G-Chip allows fast 
      detection without any complex operation and can be recycled for at least 50 times. 
      The assay, and the G-Chip in particular, has the potential for further development 
      of point-of-care (POC) diagnostics.

AB  - Human endeavours into deep space exploration and the prospects of establishing 
      colonies on nearby planets would invariably involve components of bioregenerative 
      life support for food production, cabin atmosphere renewal, and waste recycling. 
      Growing plants and their microbiomes in porous media under different gravitational 
      fields may present new challenges due to effects of liquid distribution on gaseous 
      exchange with roots and microorganisms. We provide the first direct evidence that 
      capillary driven liquid reconfiguration in porous media under reduced gravity 
      conditions reduces oxygen diffusion pathways and enhances anoxic conditions within 
      bacterial hotspots. Parabolic flight experiments using model porous media inoculated 
      with aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria reveal the systematic enhancement of 
      anoxic conditions during the reduced gravity periods in the presence but not in the 
      absence of bacterial activity. The promotion of anoxic conditions under reduced 
      gravity may lead to higher nitrous oxide and methane emissions relative to Earth 
      conditions, on the other hand, anoxic conditions could be beneficial for perchlorate 
      bioremediation of Martian soil. The results highlight changes in soil bacterial 
      microhabitats under reduced gravity and the challenges of managing bioregenerative 
      life support systems in space.

TI  - Redox potential driven aeration during very-high-gravity ethanol fermentation by 
      using flocculating yeast.
PG  - 25763

LID - 25763
AB  - Ethanol fermentation requires oxygen to maintain high biomass and cell viability, 
      especially under very-high-gravity (VHG) condition. In this work, fermentation redox 
      potential (ORP) was applied to drive the aeration process at low dissolved oxygen 
      (DO) levels, which is infeasible to be regulated by a DO sensor. The performance and 
      characteristics of flocculating yeast grown under 300 and 260 g glucose/L conditions 
      were subjected to various aeration strategies including: no aeration; controlled 
      aeration at -150, -100 and -50 mV levels; and constant aeration at 0.05 and 0.2 vvm. 
      The results showed that anaerobic fermentation produced the least ethanol and had 
      the highest residual glucose after 72 h of fermentation. Controlled aerations, 
      depending on the real-time oxygen demand, led to higher cell viability than the 
      no-aeration counterpart. Constant aeration triggered a quick biomass formation, and 
      fast glucose utilization. However, over aeration at 0.2 vvm caused a reduction of 
      final ethanol concentration. The controlled aeration driven by ORP under VHG 
      conditions resulted in the best fermentation performance. Moreover, the controlled 
      aeration could enhance yeast flocculating activity, promote an increase of flocs 
      size, and accelerate yeast separation near the end of fermentation.

TI  - An In Vitro Pilot Study Comparing the Novel HemoClear Gravity-Driven Microfiltration 
      Cell Salvage System with the Conventional Centrifugal XTRA™ Autotransfusion Device.
PG  - 9584186

AB  - BACKGROUND: In 2013, the World Health Organization reported a shortage of 17 million 
      red blood cell units, a number that remains growing. Acts to relieve this shortage 
      have primarily focused on allogeneic blood collection. Nevertheless, autologous 
      transfusion can partially alleviate the current pressure and dependence on blood 
      banking systems. To achieve this, current gold standard autotransfusion devices 
      should be complemented with widely available, cost-efficient, and time-efficient 
      devices. The novel HemoClear cell salvage device (HemoClear BV, Zwolle, 
      Netherlands), a gravity-driven microfilter, potentially is widely employable. We 
      evaluated its performance in the cardiac postoperative setting compared to the 
      centrifugal XTRA™ autotransfusion device. METHODS: In a split-unit study (n = 18), 
      shed blood collected 18 hours after cardiothoracic surgery was divided into two 
      equal volumes. One-half was processed by the XTRA™ device and the other with the 
      HemoClear blood separation system. In this paired set-up, equal washing volumes were 
      used for both methods. Washing effectivity and cellular recovery were determined by 
      measuring of complete blood count, free hemoglobin, complement C3, complement C4, 
      and D-dimer in both concentrate as filtrate. Also, processing times and volumes were 
      evaluated. RESULTS: The HemoClear and XTRA™ devices showed equal effectiveness in 
      concentrating erythrocytes and leucocytes. Both methods reduced complement C3, 
      complement C4, and D-dimer by ≥90%. The centrifugal device reduced solutes more 
      significantly by up to 99%. Free hemoglobin load was reduced to 12.9% and 15.5% by 
      the XTRA™ and HemoClear, respectively. CONCLUSION: The HemoClear device effectively 
      produced washed concentrated red blood cells comparably to the conventional 
      centrifugal XTRA™ autotransfusion device. Although the centrifugal XTRA™ device 
      achieved a significantly higher reduction in contaminants, the HemoClear device 
      achieved acceptable blood quality and seems promising in settings where gold 
      standard cell savers are unaffordable or unpractical.

TI  - Film thickness distribution in gravity-driven pancake-shaped droplets rising in a 
      Hele-Shaw cell.
PG  - 1021-1040
LID - 10.1017/jfm.2019.453 [doi]
AB  - We study here experimentally, numerically and using a lubrication approach, the 
      shape, velocity and lubrication film thickness distribution of a droplet rising in a 
      vertical Hele-Shaw cell. The droplet is surrounded by a stationary immiscible fluid 
      and moves purely due to buoyancy. A low density difference between the two media 
      helps to operate in a regime with capillary number Ca lying between 0.03 and 0.35, 
      where Ca =μ(o) U(d) /γ is built with the surrounding oil viscosity γ(0) , the 
      droplet velocity U(d) and surface tension γ. The experimental data show that in this 
      regime the droplet velocity is not influenced by the thickness of the thin 
      lubricating film and the dynamic meniscus. For iso-viscous cases, experimental and 
      three-dimensional numerical results of the film thickness distribution agree well 
      with each other. The mean film thickness is well captured by the Aussillous & Quéré 
      (Phys. Fluids, vol. 12 (10), 2000, pp. 2367-2371) model with fitting parameters. The 
      droplet also exhibits the 'catamaran' shape that has been identified experimentally 
      for a pressure-driven counterpart (Huerre et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., vol. 115 (6), 
      2015, 064501). This pattern has been rationalized using a two-dimensional 
      lubrication equation. In particular, we show that this peculiar film thickness 
      distribution is intrinsically related to the anisotropy of the fluxes induced by the 
      droplet's motion.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a modified gravity method by introducing centrifugal force 
      to promote the stacking of silica particles and the order of formed colloidal 
      crystals. In this method, a monodispersed silica colloidal solution is filled into 
      empty cells and placed onto rotation arms that are designed to apply an external 
      centrifugal force to the filled silica solution. When sample fabrication is in 
      progress, silica particles are forced toward the edges of the cells. The number of 
      defects in the colloidal crystal decreases and the structural order increases during 
      this process. The highest reflectivity and structural order of a sample was obtained 
      when the external centrifugal force was 18 G. Compared to the samples prepared using 
      the conventional stacking method, samples fabricated with centrifugal force possess 
      higher reflectivity and structural order. The reflectivity increases from 68% to 
      90%, with an increase in centrifugal force from 0 to 18 G.

TI  - Contact Line Instability of Gravity-Driven Flow of Power-Law Fluids.
PG  - 62-69
AB  - The moving contact line of a thin fluid film can often corrugate into fingers, which 
      is also known as a fingering instability. Although the fingering instability of 
      Newtonian fluids has been studied extensively, there are few studies published on 
      contact line fingering instability of non-Newtonian fluids. In particular, it is 
      still unknown how shear-thinning rheological properties can affect the formation, 
      growth, and shape of a contact line instability. Our previous study (Hu and Kieweg, 
      2012) showed a decreased capillary ridge formation for more shear-thinning fluids in 
      a 2D model (i.e. 1D thin film spreading within the scope of lubrication theory). 
      Those results motivated this study's hypothesis: more shear-thinning fluids should 
      have suppressed finger growth and longer finger wavelength, and this should be 
      evident in linear stability analysis (LSA) and 3D (i.e. 2D spreading) numerical 
      simulations. In this study, we developed a LSA model for the gravity-driven flow of 
      shear-thinning films, and carried out a parametric study to investigate the impact 
      of shear-thinning on the growth rate of the emerging fingering pattern. A fully 3D 
      model was also developed to compare and verify the LSA results using single 
      perturbations, and to explore the result of multiple-mode, randomly imposed 
      perturbations. Both the LSA and 3D numerical results confirmed that the contact line 
      fingers grow faster for Newtonian fluids than the shear-thinning fluids on both 
      vertical and inclined planes. In addition, both the LSA and 3D model indicated that 
      the Newtonian fluids form fingers with shorter wavelengths than the shear-thinning 
      fluids when the plane is inclined; no difference in the most unstable (i.e. 
      emerging) wavelength was observed at vertical. This study also showed that the 
      distance between emerging fingers was smaller on a vertical plane than on a 
      less-inclined plane for shear-thinning fluids, as previously shown for Newtonian 
      fluids. For the first time for shear-thinning fluids, these results connect trends 
      in capillary ridge and contact line finger formation in 2D models, LSA, and 3D 
      simulations. The results can provide us insights on how to optimize non-Newtonian 
      fluid properties to minimize a fingering instability in many industrial and 
      biological applications.

AB  - Atmospheric gravity waves generated by an eclipse were first proposed in 1970. 
      Despite numerous efforts since, there has been no definitive evidence for eclipse 
      generated gravity waves in the lower to middle atmosphere. Measuring wave 
      characteristics produced by a definite forcing event such as an eclipse provides 
      crucial knowledge for developing more accurate physical descriptions of gravity 
      waves. These waves are fundamental to the transport of energy and momentum 
      throughout the atmosphere and their parameterization or simulation in numerical 
      models provides increased accuracy to forecasts. Here, we present the findings from 
      a radiosonde field campaign carried out during the total solar eclipse of July 2, 
      2019 aimed at detecting eclipse-driven gravity waves in the stratosphere. This 
      eclipse was the source of three stratospheric gravity waves. The first wave (eclipse 
      wave #1) was detected 156 min after totality and the other two waves were detected 
      53 and 62 min after totality (eclipse waves #2 and #3 respectively) using 
      balloon-borne radiosondes. Our results demonstrate both the importance of field 
      campaign design and the limitations of currently accepted balloon-borne analysis 
      techniques for the detection of stratospheric gravity waves.

AB  - This article contains flow visualization data from experiments conducted in an 
      inclined gravity-driven soap film intersected by a circular cylinder undergoing 
      controlled transverse oscillations at a Reynolds number of Re ≈ 235 . The 
      dimensionless frequency and amplitude of cylinder oscillation were varied 
      systematically over the ranges 0.2 < f* < 1.8 and 0.1 < A* < 1.3 . A high-speed 
      camera was used to capture the interference fringe patterns reflected from the soap 
      film. These videos show the structure of the wake behind the cylinder, including the 
      initial formation of vortices and the extended 'vortex street'. Several wake 
      patterns were identified, including the classic 2S, P+S, 2P, and 2T patterns, which 
      are discussed in detail in the accompanying research article titled "The wake of a 
      transversely oscillating circular cylinder in a flowing soap film at low Reynolds 
      number" [1]. The videos presented in this article can be accessed through the

TI  - UniChip enables long-term recirculating unidirectional perfusion with gravity-driven 
      flow for microphysiological systems.
PG  - 2563-2574
LID - 10.1039/c8lc00394g [doi]
AB  - Microphysiological systems, also known as body-on-a-chips, are promising "human 
      surrogates" that may be used to evaluate potential human response to drugs in 
      preclinical drug development. Various microfluidics-based platforms have been 
      proposed to interconnect different organ models and provide perfusion in mimicking 
      the blood circulation. We have previously developed a pumpless platform that 
      combines gravity-driven fluid flow and a rocking motion to create reciprocating flow 
      between reservoirs for recirculation. Such platform allows design of self-contained 
      and highly integrated systems that are relatively easy and cost-effective to 
      construct and maintain. To integrate vasculature and other shear stress-sensitive 
      tissues (e.g. lung and kidney) into pumpless body-on-a-chips, we propose "UniChip" 
      fluid network design, which transforms reciprocating flow input into unidirectional 
      perfusion in the channel(s) of interest by utilizing supporting channels and passive 
      valves. The design enables unidirectional organ perfusion with recirculation on the 
      pumpless platform and provides an effective backflow-proof mechanism. To demonstrate 
      principles of UniChip design, we created a demonstration chip with a single straight 
      channel as a simple example of the organ perfusion network. A BiChip providing 
      bidirectional perfusion was used for comparison. Computational and experimental 
      fluid dynamic characterization of the UniChip confirmed continuous unidirectional 
      flow in the perfusion channel and the backflow-proof mechanism. Vascular endothelial 
      cells cultured on UniChips for 5 d showed changes matching cell responses to 
      unidirectional laminar flows. Those include cell elongation and alignment to the 
      flow direction, continuous network of VE-cadherin at cell borders, realignment of 
      F-actin and suppressed cell proliferation. Cells on BiChips manifested distinct 
      responses that are close to responses to oscillatory flows, where cells remain a 
      polygonal shape with intermittent VE-cadherin networks and few F-actin realignment. 
      These results demonstrate that microfluidic devices of UniChip design provide 
      recirculating unidirectional perfusion suitable for long-term culture of shear 
      stress-sensitive tissues. This is the first time a gravity-drive flow system has 
      achieved continuous unidirectional perfusion with recirculation. The inherent 
      backflow-proof mechanism allows hassle-free long-term operation of body-on-a-chips. 
      Overall, our UniChip design provides a reliable and cost-effective solution for the 
      integration of vasculature and other shear stress-sensitive tissues into pumpless 
      recirculating body-on-a-chips, which can expedite the development and widespread 
      application of moderately high-throughput, high-content microphysiological systems.

AB  - In the evaporation of microlitre liquid droplets, the accepted view is that surface 
      tension dominates and the effect of gravity is negligible. We report, through the 
      first use of rotating optical coherence tomography, that a change in the flow 
      pattern and speed occurs when evaporating binary liquid droplets are tilted, 
      conclusively showing that gravitational effects dominate the flow. We use gas 
      chromatography to show that these flows are solutal in nature, and we establish a 
      flow phase diagram demonstrating the conditions under which different flow 
      mechanisms occur.

TI  - Across-session consistency of context-driven language processing: A 
      magnetoencephalography study.
PG  - 3457-3469
LID - 10.1111/ejn.14785 [doi]
AB  - Changes in brain organization following damage are commonly observed, but they 
      remain poorly understood. These changes are often studied with imaging techniques 
      that overlook the temporal granularity at which language processes occur. By 
      contrast, electrophysiological measures provide excellent temporal resolution. To 
      test the suitability of magnetoencephalography (MEG) to track language-related 
      neuroplasticity, the present study aimed at establishing the spectro-temporo-spatial 
      across-session consistency of context-driven picture naming in healthy individuals, 
      using MEG in two test-retest sessions. Spectro-temporo-spatial test-retest 
      consistency in a healthy population is a prerequisite for studying neuronal changes 
      in clinical populations over time. For this purpose, 15 healthy speakers were tested 
      with MEG while performing a context-driven picture-naming task at two time points. 
      Participants read a sentence missing the final word and named a picture completing 
      the sentence. Sentences were constrained or unconstrained toward the picture, such 
      that participants could either retrieve the picture name through sentence context 
      (constrained sentences), or could only name it after the picture appeared 
      (unconstrained sentences). The context effect (constrained versus unconstrained) in 
      picture-naming times had a strong effect size and high across-session consistency. 
      The context MEG results revealed alpha-beta power decreases (10-20 Hz) in the left 
      temporal and inferior parietal lobule that were consistent across both sessions. As 
      robust spectro-temporo-spatial findings in a healthy population are required for 
      working toward longitudinal patient studies, we conclude that using context-driven 
      language production and MEG is a suitable way to examine language-related 
      neuroplasticity after brain damage.

TI  - Data-driven discovery of emergent behaviors in collective dynamics.
LID - 132542 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.physd.2020.132542 [doi]
AB  - Particle- and agent-based systems are a ubiquitous modeling tool in many 
      disciplines. We consider the fundamental problem of inferring the governing 
      structure, i.e. interaction kernels, in a nonparametric fashion, from observations 
      of agent-based dynamical systems. In particular, we are interested in collective 
      dynamical systems exhibiting emergent behaviors with complicated interaction 
      kernels, and for kernels which are parameterized by a single unknown parameter. This 
      work extends the estimators introduced in Lu et al. (2019), which are based on 
      suitably regularized least squares estimators, to these larger classes of systems. 
      We provide extensive numerical evidence that the estimators provide faithful 
      approximations to the interaction kernels, and provide accurate predictions for 
      trajectories started at new initial conditions, both throughout the "training" time 
      interval in which the observations were made, and often much beyond. We demonstrate 
      these features on prototypical systems displaying collective behaviors, ranging from 
      opinion dynamics, flocking dynamics, self-propelling particle dynamics, synchronized 
      oscillator dynamics, to a gravitational system. Our experiments also suggest that 
      our estimated systems can display the same emergent behaviors as the observed 
      systems, including those that occur at larger timescales than those in the training 
      data. Finally, in the case of families of systems governed by a parametric family of 
      interaction kernels, we introduce novel estimators that estimate the parametric 
      family of kernels, splitting it into a common interaction kernel and the action of 
      parameters. We demonstrate this in the case of gravity, by learning both the "common 
      component" 1/r (2) and the dependency on mass, without any a priori knowledge of 
      either one, from observations of planetary motions in our solar system.

AB  - Self-switching microfluidic circuits that are able to perform biochemical 
      experiments in a parallel and autonomous manner, similar to instruction-embedded 
      electronics, are rarely implemented. Here, we present design principles and 
      demonstrations for gravity-driven, integrated, microfluidic pulsatile flow circuits. 
      With a common gravity head as the only driving force, these fluidic oscillator 
      arrays realize a wide range of periods (0.4 s-2 h) and flow rates 
      (0.10-63 μl min(-1)) with completely independent timing between the multiple 
      oscillator sub-circuits connected in parallel. As a model application, we perform 
      systematic, parallel analysis of endothelial cell elongation response to different 
      fluidic shearing patterns generated by the autonomous microfluidic pulsed flow 
      generation system.

AB  - Orienting attention in the space around us is a fundamental prerequisite for willed 
      actions. On Earth, at 1 g, orienting attention requires the integration of 
      vestibular signals and vision, although the specific vestibular contribution to 
      voluntary and automatic components of visuospatial attention remains largely 
      unknown. Here, we show that unweighting of the otolith organ in zero gravity during 
      parabolic flight, selectively enhances stimulus-driven capture of automatic 
      visuospatial attention, while weakening voluntary maintenance of covert attention. 
      These findings, besides advancing our comprehension of the basic influence of the 
      vestibular function on voluntary and automatic components of visuospatial attention, 
      may have operational implications for the identification of effective 
      countermeasures to be applied in forthcoming human deep space exploration and 
      habitation, and on Earth, for patients' rehabilitation.

AB  - In swarms of flying insects, the motions of individuals are largely uncoordinated 
      with those of their neighbours, unlike the highly ordered motion of bird flocks. 
      However, it has been observed that insects may transiently form pairs with 
      synchronized relative motion while moving through the swarm. The origin of this 
      phenomenon remains an open question. In particular, it is not known if pairing is a 
      new behavioural process or whether it is a natural by-product of typical swarming 
      behaviour. Here, using an 'adaptive-gravity' model that proposes that insects 
      interact via long-range gravity-like acoustic attractions that are modulated by the 
      total background sound (via 'adaptivity' or fold-change detection) and that 
      reproduces measured features of real swarms, we show that pair formation can indeed 
      occur without the introduction of additional behavioural rules. In the model, pairs 
      form robustly whenever two insects happen to move together from the centre of the 
      swarm (where the background sound is high) towards the swarm periphery (where the 
      background sound is low). Due to adaptivity, the attraction between the pair 
      increases as the background sound decreases, thereby forming a bound state since 
      their relative kinetic energy is smaller than their pair-potential energy. When the 
      pair moves into regions of high background sound, however, the process is reversed 
      and the pair may break up. Our results suggest that pairing should appear generally 
      in biological systems with long-range attraction and adaptive sensing, such as 
      during chemotaxis-driven cellular swarming.

TI  - Thermocapillarity in Microfluidics-A Review.
LID - 10.3390/mi7010013 [doi]
LID - 13
AB  - This paper reviews the past and recent studies on thermocapillarity in relation to 
      microfluidics. The role of thermocapillarity as the change of surface tension due to 
      temperature gradient in developing Marangoni flow in liquid films and conclusively 
      bubble and drop actuation is discussed. The thermocapillary-driven mass transfer 
      (the so-called Benard-Marangoni effect) can be observed in liquid films, reservoirs, 
      bubbles and droplets that are subject to the temperature gradient. Since the 
      contribution of a surface tension-driven flow becomes more prominent when the scale 
      becomes smaller as compared to a pressure-driven flow, microfluidic applications 
      based on thermocapillary effect are gaining attentions recently. The effect of 
      thermocapillarity on the flow pattern inside liquid films is the initial focus of 
      this review. Analysis of the relation between evaporation and thermocapillary 
      instability approves the effect of Marangoni flow on flow field inside the drop and 
      its evaporation rate. The effect of thermocapillary on producing Marangoni flow 
      inside drops and liquid films, leads to actuation of drops and bubbles due to the 
      drag at the interface, mass conservation, and also gravity and buoyancy in vertical 
      motion. This motion can happen inside microchannels with a closed multiphase medium, 
      on the solid substrate as in solid/liquid interaction, or on top of a carrier liquid 
      film in open microfluidic systems. Various thermocapillary-based microfluidic 
      devices have been proposed and developed for different purposes such as actuation, 
      sensing, trapping, sorting, mixing, chemical reaction, and biological assays 
      throughout the years. A list of the thermocapillary based microfluidic devices along 
      with their characteristics, configurations, limitations, and improvements are 
      presented in this review.

TI  - Gravity driven deterministic lateral displacement for suspended particles in a 3D 
      obstacle array.
PG  - 31428
LID - 10.1038/srep31428 [doi]
LID - 31428
AB  - We present a simple modification to enhance the separation ability of deterministic 
      lateral displacement (DLD) systems by expanding the two-dimensional nature of these 
      devices and driving the particles into size-dependent, fully three-dimensional 
      trajectories. Specifically, we drive the particles through an array of long 
      cylindrical posts, such that they not only move parallel to the basal plane of the 
      posts as in traditional two-dimensional DLD systems (in-plane motion), but also 
      along the axial direction of the solid posts (out-of-plane motion). We show that the 
      (projected) in-plane motion of the particles is completely analogous to that 
      observed in 2D-DLD systems. In fact, a theoretical model originally developed for 
      force-driven, two-dimensional DLD systems accurately describes the experimental 
      results. More importantly, we analyze the particles out-of-plane motion and observe, 
      for certain orientations of the driving force, significant differences in the 
      out-of-plane displacement depending on particle size. Therefore, taking advantage of 
      both the in-plane and out-of-plane motion of the particles, it is possible to 
      achieve the simultaneous fractionation of a polydisperse suspension into multiple 
      streams.

AB  - The aim of this prospective study was to compare quality of blood products produced 
      either by a novel gravity-driven hollow-fiber separation system (HF) or by 
      centrifugation (C). Whole blood was obtained from 31 healthy non-greyhound canine 
      blood donors and separated into fresh frozen plasma and packed red blood cells using 
      either HF or C in a university teaching hospital. Red blood cell (RBC) count, 
      albumin and fibrinogen concentration, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial 
      thromboplastin time (aPTT) and coagulation factor activity (FV, FVIII), von 
      Willebrand Factor (vWF), and antithrombin activity were assessed. Plasma obtained 
      with the HF showed a significantly higher median PT (9.4 vs. 7.9 s, P = 0.0006) and 
      aPTT (14.9 vs. 13.1 s, P = 0.0128) than plasma prepared with C. Lower albumin (21.7 
      vs. 23.5 g/l, P = 0.0162) and fibrinogen (1.0 vs. 1.5 g/l, P = 0.0005) 
      concentrations and activities of FV (105 vs. 114%, P = 0.0021) and antithrombin (104 
      vs. 117%, P = 0.0024) were seen in blood products obtained with the HF. In contrast, 
      vWF was not affected by the method of plasma separation. Compared to HF, RBC count 
      as well as hematocrit were not significantly higher (8.0 vs. 8.9 10(12)/l, P = 
      0.1308; 0.57 vs. 0.62 l/l, P = 0.0736) when blood products were prepared with C. In 
      conclusion, higher quality of blood products especially regarding coagulation 
      parameters and RBCs was achieved by using C compared to HF. Despite the statistical 
      significances, however, the clinical relevance has to be further elucidated. 
      Nevertheless, HF provides an alternative to produce blood products if a centrifuge 
      is not available.

TI  - Simultaneous Droplet Generation with In-Series Droplet T-Junctions Induced by 
      Gravity-Induced Flow.
LID - 10.3390/mi12101211 [doi]
LID - 1211
AB  - Droplet microfluidics offers a wide range of applications, including high-throughput 
      drug screening and single-cell DNA amplification. However, these platforms are often 
      limited to single-input conditions that prevent them from analyzing multiple input 
      parameters (e.g., combined cellular treatments) in a single experiment. Droplet 
      multiplexing will result in higher overall throughput, lowering cost of fabrication, 
      and cutting down the hands-on time in number of applications such as single-cell 
      analysis. Additionally, while lab-on-a-chip fabrication costs have decreased in 
      recent years, the syringe pumps required for generating droplets of uniform shape 
      and size remain cost-prohibitive for researchers interested in utilizing droplet 
      microfluidics. This work investigates the potential of simultaneously generating 
      droplets from a series of three in-line T-junctions utilizing gravity-driven flow to 
      produce consistent, well-defined droplets. Implementing reservoirs with equal 
      heights produced inconsistent flow rates that increased as a function of the 
      distance between the aqueous inlets and the oil inlet. Optimizing the three 
      reservoir heights identified that taller reservoirs were needed for aqueous inlets 
      closer to the oil inlet. Studying the relationship between the ratio of oil-to-water 
      flow rates (Φ) found that increasing Φ resulted in smaller droplets and an enhanced 
      droplet generation rate. An ANOVA was performed on droplet diameter to confirm no 
      significant difference in droplet size from the three different aqueous inlets. The 
      work described here offers an alternative approach to multiplexed droplet 
      microfluidic devices allowing for the high-throughput interrogation of three sample 
      conditions in a single device. It also has provided an alternative method to induce 
      droplet formation that does not require multiple syringe pumps.

TI  - The Effect of Surface Tension on the Gravity-driven Thin Film Flow of Newtonian and 
      Power-law Fluids.
PG  - 83-90
LID - 10.1016/j.compfluid.2012.05.009
AB  - Gravity-driven thin film flow is of importance in many fields, as well as for the 
      design of polymeric drug delivery vehicles, such as anti-HIV topical microbicides. 
      There have been many prior works on gravity-driven thin films. However, the 
      incorporation of surface tension effect has not been well studied for non-Newtonian 
      fluids. After surface tension effect was incorporated into our 2D (i.e. 1D 
      spreading) power-law model, we found that surface tension effect not only impacted 
      the spreading speed of the microbicide gel, but also had an influence on the shape 
      of the 2D spreading profile. We observed a capillary ridge at the front of the fluid 
      bolus. Previous literature shows that the emergence of a capillary ridge is strongly 
      related to the contact line fingering instability. Fingering instabilities during 
      epithelial coating may change the microbicide gel distribution and therefore impact 
      how well it can protect the epithelium. In this study, we focused on the capillary 
      ridge in 2D flow and performed a series of simulations and showed how the capillary 
      ridge height varies with other parameters, such as surface tension coefficient, 
      inclination angle, initial thickness, and power-law parameters. As shown in our 
      results, we found that capillary ridge height increased with higher surface tension, 
      steeper inclination angle, bigger initial thickness, and more Newtonian fluids. This 
      study provides the initial insights of how to optimize the flow and prevent the 
      appearance of a capillary ridge and fingering instability.

TI  - Trapping of swimming microalgae in foam.
PG  - 20200077
LID - 10.1098/rsif.2020.0077 [doi]
LID - 20200077
AB  - Massive foam formation in aquatic environments is a seasonal event that has a 
      significant impact on the stability of marine ecosystems. Liquid foams are known to 
      filter passive solid particles, with large particles remaining trapped by 
      confinement in the network of liquid channels and small particles being freely 
      advected by the gravity-driven flow. By contrast, the potential role of a similar 
      retention effect on biologically active particles such as phytoplankton cells is 
      still relatively unknown. To assess if phytoplankton cells are passively advected 
      through a foam, the model unicellular motile alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (CR) was 
      incorporated in a bio-compatible foam, and the number of cells escaping the foam at 
      the bottom was measured in time. Comparing the escape dynamics of living and dead CR 
      cells, we found that dead cells are totally advected by the liquid flow towards the 
      bottom of the foam, as expected since the diameter of CR remains smaller than the 
      typical foam channel diameter. By contrast, living motile CR cells escape the foam 
      at a significantly lower rate: after 2 hours, up to 60% of the injected cells may 
      remain blocked in the foam, while 95% of the initial liquid volume in the foam has 
      been drained out of the foam. Microscopic observation of the swimming CR cells in a 
      chamber mimicking the cross-section of foam internal channels revealed that swimming 
      CR cells accumulate near channels corners. A theoretical analysis based on the 
      probability density measurements in the micro chambers has shown that this trapping 
      at the microscopic scale contributes to explain the macroscopic retention of the 
      microswimmers in the foam. At the crossroads of distinct fields including marine 
      ecology of planktonic organisms, fluid dynamics of active particles in a confined 
      environment and the physics of foam, this work represents a significant step in the 
      fundamental understanding of the ecological consequences of aquatic foams in water 
      bodies.

TI  - Self-disproportionation of enantiomers of thalidomide and its fluorinated analogue 
      via gravity-driven achiral chromatography: mechanistic rationale and implications.
PG  - 1043-1048
LID - 10.1039/c4sc03047h [doi]
AB  - We report on the self-disproportionation of enantiomers (SDE) of non-racemic 
      thalidomide (1) and 3'-fluorothalidomide (2) under the conditions of gravity-driven 
      achiral silica-gel chromatography. The presence of a fluorine atom on the chiral 
      center dramatically alters the structure and polarity of 1 and 2, resulting in the 
      opposite SDE profile on silica-gel.

TI  - Liquid-Infused Membranes with Oil-in-Water Emulsions.
PG  - 9513-9520
LID - 10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b01055 [doi]
AB  - Liquid-infused membranes have been introduced to membrane technology recently. The 
      infusion liquid can be expelled, opening the pore, in response to an immiscible feed 
      liquid pressure. In the open state, the pore wall is still covered with the infusion 
      liquid forming the so-called liquid-lined pores. Liquid lining is expected to give 
      anti-fouling properties to these membranes. The pressure-responsive pores can be 
      used for efficient sorting of fluids from a mixture based on interfacial tension. 
      For example, in a two-phase mixture of immiscible liquids, the required liquid entry 
      pressure is different for the constituent liquids. Here, we investigate the 
      capability of liquid-infused membranes for selective permeation of the dispersed 
      phase, that is, oil from an oil-in-water (O/W) emulsion. The separation experiments 
      are conducted in a dead-end pressure-controlled filtration cell using liquid-infused 
      and non-infused membranes. In order to permeate the dispersed phase, oil droplets 
      should come in contact with the membrane surface which is accomplished here by 
      gravity-driven creaming. Our results reveal that by setting the feed pressure 
      between the entry pressure of oil and that of the surfactant solution, oil can be 
      successfully permeated. For high concentrations of surfactants, water also permeated 
      partly. The amount of water permeated through liquid-infused membranes is lower than 
      that through non-infused membranes, caused by the corresponding interfacial 
      tensions. The results suggest that the presence of the infusion liquid in the 
      membrane gives rise to the formation of three-phase interfaces in the pore, namely, 
      the interface between surfactant solution-oil (γ(12)) and that between oil-infusion 
      liquid (γ(23)). Based on the interfacial energy contributions, the additional 
      interface between oil and the infusion liquid gives rise to an increase in the 
      liquid entry pressure for the surfactant solution based on the combined interfacial 
      tension (γ(12) + γ(23)) leading to less water permeation.

TI  - Volcano seismicity and ground deformation unveil the gravity-driven magma discharge 
      dynamics of a volcanic eruption.
PG  - 6998
LID - 10.1038/ncomms7998 [doi]
AB  - Effusive eruptions are explained as the mechanism by which volcanoes restore the 
      equilibrium perturbed by magma rising in a chamber deep in the crust. Seismic, 
      ground deformation and topographic measurements are compared with effusion rate 
      during the 2007 Stromboli eruption, drawing an eruptive scenario that shifts our 
      attention from the interior of the crust to the surface. The eruption is modelled as 
      a gravity-driven drainage of magma stored in the volcanic edifice with a minor 
      contribution of magma supplied at a steady rate from a deep reservoir. Here we show 
      that the discharge rate can be predicted by the contraction of the volcano edifice 
      and that the very-long-period seismicity migrates downwards, tracking the residual 
      volume of magma in the shallow reservoir. Gravity-driven magma discharge dynamics 
      explain the initially high discharge rates observed during eruptive crises and 
      greatly influence our ability to predict the evolution of effusive eruptions.

TI  - Gravity-Driven Thin Film Flow of an Ellis Fluid.
PG  - 88-98
AB  - The thin film lubrication approximation has been studied extensively for moving 
      contact lines of Newtonian fluids. However, many industrial and biological 
      applications of the thin film equation involve shear-thinning fluids, which often 
      also exhibit a Newtonian plateau at low shear. This study presents new numerical 
      simulations of the three-dimensional (i.e. two-dimensional spreading), 
      constant-volume, gravity-driven, free surface flow of an Ellis fluid. The numerical 
      solution was validated with a new similarity solution, compared to previous 
      experiments, and then used in a parametric study. The parametric study centered 
      around rheological data for an example biological application of thin film flow: 
      topical drug delivery of anti-HIV microbicide formulations, e.g. 
      hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC) polymer solutions. The parametric study evaluated how 
      spreading length and front velocity saturation depend on Ellis parameters. A lower 
      concentration polymer solution with smaller zero shear viscosity (η(0)), τ(1/2), and 
      λ values spread further. However, when comparing any two fluids with any possible 
      combinations of Ellis parameters, the impact of changing one parameter on spreading 
      length depends on the direction and magnitude of changes in the other two 
      parameters. In addition, the isolated effect of the shear-thinning parameter, λ, on 
      the front velocity saturation depended on τ(1/2). This study highlighted the 
      relative effects of the individual Ellis parameters, and showed that the shear rates 
      in this flow were in both the shear-thinning and plateau regions of rheological 
      behavior, emphasizing the importance of characterizing the full range of shear-rates 
      in rheological measurements. The validated numerical model and parametric study 
      provides a useful tool for future steps to optimize flow of a fluid with rheological 
      behavior well-described by the Ellis constitutive model, in a range of industrial 
      and biological applications.

AB  - Orbital telorism, the interocular distance, is clinically informative and in 
      extremes is considered a minor physical anomaly. While its extremes, hypo- and 
      hypertelorism, have been linked to disorders often related to cognitive ability, 
      little is known about the neural correlates of normal variation of telorism within 
      the general population. We derived measures of orbital telorism from cranial 
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) by calculating the distance between the eyeball 
      center of gravity in two population-based datasets (N = 5,653, N = 29,824; mean age 
      64.66, 63.75 years). This measure was found to be related to grey matter tissue 
      density within numerous regions of the brain, including, but surprisingly not 
      limited to, the frontal regions, in both positive and negative directions. 
      Additionally, telorism was related to several cognitive functions, such as Purdue 
      pegboard test (Beta, P-value (CI95%) -.02, 1.63 × 10(-7) (-.03:-.01)) and fluid 
      intelligence (.02, 4.75 × 10(-6) (.01:0.02)), with some relationships driven by 
      individuals with a smaller orbital telorism. This is reflective of the higher 
      prevalence of hypotelorism in developmental disorders, specifically those that 
      accompany lower cognitive lower functioning. This study suggests, despite previous 
      links only made in clinical extremes, that orbital telorism holds some relation to 
      structural brain development and cognitive function in the general population. This 
      relationship is likely driven by shared developmental periods.

TI  - Gravity-Based Precise Cell Manipulation System Enhanced by In-Phase Mechanism.
LID - 10.3390/mi7070116 [doi]
LID - 116
AB  - This paper proposes a gravity-based system capable of generating high-resolution 
      pressure for precise cell manipulation or evaluation in a microfluidic channel. 
      While the pressure resolution of conventional pumps for microfluidic applications is 
      usually about hundreds of pascals as the resolution of their feedback sensors, 
      precise cell manipulation at the pascal level cannot be done. The proposed system 
      successfully achieves a resolution of 100 millipascals using water head pressure 
      with an in-phase noise cancelation mechanism. The in-phase mechanism aims to 
      suppress the noises from ambient vibrations to the system. The proposed pressure 
      system is tested with a microfluidic platform for pressure validation. The 
      experimental results show that the in-phase mechanism effectively reduces the 
      pressure turbulence, and the pressure-driven cell movement matches the theoretical 
      simulations. Preliminary experiments on deformability evaluation with red blood 
      cells under incremental pressures of one pascal are successfully performed. 
      Different deformation patterns are observed from cell to cell under precise pressure 
      control.

AB  - The present work focuses on the postseismic deformation observed in the region of 
      L'Aquila (central Italy) following the Mw 6.3 earthquake that occurred on April 6, 
      2009. A new, 16-month-long dataset of COSMO-SkyMed SAR images was analysed using the 
      Persistent Scatterer Pairs interferometric technique. The analysis revealed the 
      existence of postseismic ground subsidence in the mountainous rocky area of Mt Ocre 
      ridge, contiguous to the sedimentary plain that experienced coseismic subsidence. 
      The postseismic subsidence was characterized by displacements of 10 to 35 mm along 
      the SAR line of sight. In the Mt Ocre ridge, widespread morphological elements 
      associated with gravitational spreading have been previously mapped. We tested the 
      hypothesis that the postseismic subsidence of the Mt Ocre ridge compensates the loss 
      of equilibrium induced by the nearby coseismic subsidence. Therefore, we simulated 
      the coseismic and postseismic displacement fields via the finite element method. We 
      included the gravitational load and fault slip and accounted for the geometrical and 
      rheological characteristics of the area. We found that the elastoplastic behaviour 
      of the material under gravitational loading best explains the observed postseismic 
      displacement. These findings emphasize the role of gravity in the postseismic 
      processes at the fault scale.

TI  - Experimental and numerical models of three-dimensional gravity-driven flow of 
      shear-thinning polymer solutions used in vaginal delivery of microbicides.

AB  - HIV/AIDS is a growing global pandemic. A microbicide is a formulation of a 
      pharmaceutical agent suspended in a delivery vehicle, and can be used by women to 
      protect themselves against HIV infection during intercourse. We have developed a 
      three-dimensional (3D) computational model of a shear-thinning power-law fluid 
      spreading under the influence of gravity to represent the distribution of a 
      microbicide gel over the vaginal epithelium. This model, accompanied by a new 
      experimental methodology, is a step in developing a tool for optimizing a delivery 
      vehicle's structure/function relationship for clinical application. We compare our 
      model with experiments in order to identify critical considerations for simulating 
      3D free-surface flows of shear-thinning fluids. Here we found that neglecting 
      lateral spreading, when modeling gravity-induced flow, resulted in up to 47% 
      overestimation of the experimental axial spreading after 90 s. In contrast, the 
      inclusion of lateral spreading in 3D computational models resulted in rms errors in 
      axial spreading under 7%. In addition, the choice of the initial condition for shape 
      in the numerical simulation influences the model's ability to describe early time 
      spreading behavior. Finally, we present a parametric study and sensitivity analysis 
      of the power-law parameters' influence on axial spreading, and to examine the impact 
      of changing rheological properties as a result of dilution or formulation 
      conditions. Both the shear-thinning index (n) and consistency (m) impacted the 
      spreading length and deceleration of the moving front. The sensitivity analysis 
      showed that gels with midrange m and n values (for the ranges in this study) would 
      be most sensitive (over 8% changes in spreading length) to 10% changes (e.g., from 
      dilution) in both rheological properties. This work is applicable to many industrial 
      and geophysical thin-film flow applications of non-Newtonian fluids; in addition to 
      biological applications in microbicide drug delivery.

TI  - Natural-Light-Initiated 3D Macro Zigzag Architecture of Graphene-Reinforced 
      Polystyrene for Gravity-Driven Oil and Water Separation.
PG  - 1800040

LID - 1800040
AB  - Superhydrophobic 3D robust materials are introduced for the separation of hexane and 
      water. For the first time, novel 3D zigzag polystyrene on graphene-incorporated 
      polyurethane (3D zz-PS/GR/PU) is prepared using exclusively natural sunlight without 
      any chemical initiator. The zigzag polystyrene growth is accomplished by 
      polymerizing the styrene vapors. The natural sunlight provides a compact 3D 
      zz-PS/GR/PU material with superoleophilic and hydrophobic channels that allow for 
      the rapid passage of oil, whereas water is entirely prevented from passing. The 3D 
      zz-PS/GR/PU compact channels are transformed into the compressible material by 
      treating them with toluene without affecting the hydrophobicity of the material. The 
      3D zz-PS/GR/PU displays a high-water contact angle of approximately 150°. The 
      developed materials are characterized by FTIR, SEM, and BET. The graphene 
      incorporation makes surface area of the 3D zz-PS/GR/PU substantially large compared 
      with PU. It is improved from 15 to 67 m(2) g(-1). The pore size of the adsorption 
      and desorption in the 3D zz-PS/GR/PU is also reduced from 354 and 352 Å to 34 and 33 
      Å. The 3D zz-PS/GR/PU satisfies the requirement of high-demanding superhydrophobic 
      materials, like a low-cost fabrication process, reusability, and tunability. This 
      strategy can trigger large-scale production with a controlled morphology.

TI  - Dielectrophoresis-driven spreading of immersed liquid droplets.
PG  - 1011-6
LID - 10.1021/la503931p [doi]
AB  - In recent years electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) has become an effective tool to 
      control partial wetting. EWOD uses the liquid-solid interface as part of a 
      capacitive structure that allows capacitive and interfacial energies to adjust by 
      changes in wetting when the liquid-solid interface is charged due to an applied 
      voltage. An important aspect of EWOD has been its applications in microfluidics in 
      chemistry and biology and in optical devices and displays in physics and 
      engineering. Many of these rely on the use of a liquid droplet immersed in a second 
      liquid due to the need either for neutral buoyancy to overcome gravity and shield 
      against impact shocks or to encapsulate the droplet for other reasons, such as in 
      microfluidic-based DNA analyses. Recently, it has been shown that nonwetting 
      oleophobic surfaces can be forcibly wetted by nonconducting oils using nonuniform 
      electric fields and an interface-localized form of liquid dielectrophoresis 
      (dielectrowetting). Here we show that this effect can be used to create films of oil 
      immersed in a second immiscible fluid of lower permittivity. We predict that the 
      square of the thickness of the film should obey a simple law dependent on the square 
      of the applied voltage and with strength dependent on the ratio of difference in 
      permittivity to the liquid-fluid interfacial tension, Δε/γ(LF). This relationship is 
      experimentally confirmed for 11 liquid-air and liquid-liquid combinations with 
      Δε/γ(LF) having a span of more than two orders of magnitude. We therefore provide 
      fundamental understanding of dielectrowetting for liquid-in-liquid systems and also 
      open up a new method to determine liquid-liquid interfacial tensions.

AB  - Self-powered implantable devices have the potential to extend device operation time 
      inside the body and reduce the necessity for high-risk repeated surgery. Without the 
      technological innovation of in vivo energy harvesters driven by biomechanical 
      energy, energy harvesters are insufficient and inconvenient to power 
      titanium-packaged implantable medical devices. Here, we report on a commercial coin 
      battery-sized high-performance inertia-driven triboelectric nanogenerator (I-TENG) 
      based on body motion and gravity. We demonstrate that the enclosed five-stacked 
      I-TENG converts mechanical energy into electricity at 4.9 μW/cm(3) (root-mean-square 
      output). In a preclinical test, we show that the device successfully harvests energy 
      using real-time output voltage data monitored via Bluetooth and demonstrate the 
      ability to charge a lithium-ion battery. Furthermore, we successfully integrate a 
      cardiac pacemaker with the I-TENG, and confirm the ventricle pacing and sensing 
      operation mode of the self-rechargeable cardiac pacemaker system. This 
      proof-of-concept device may lead to the development of new self-rechargeable 
      implantable medical devices.

      environment and for enhancing the value of ecosystem services. Based on the land use 
      remote sensing data during the rapid urbanization development period of Hubei 
      Province from 1995 to 2015, this study analyzed the characteristics of land use/land 
      cover change and land use transformation. The spatial-temporal response 
      characteristics and evolution of ecosystem services value (ESV) to land use 
      transformation driven by urbanization were measured by equivalent factor method, 
      spatial autocorrelation analysis, hot spot analysis and gravity model. We found 
      that: (1) Driven by urbanization, the most significant feature of land use 
      transformation in Hubei Province was the expansion of the built-up land and the 
      significant reduction of cropland and forest, among which 90% of the new built-up 
      land was converted from cropland and forest. (2) This land use transformation became 
      the main source of ESV losses. Especially, the sharp increase of the built-up land 
      from 2010 to 2015, occupying cropland and forest, resulted in ESV losses of nearly 
      USD 320 million. The service capacity of climate regulation, soil conservation, gas 
      regulation and food production undertaken by cropland and forest decreased. (3) The 
      ecosystem services value in the study area showed spatial distribution 
      characteristics of high in the west and low in the middle and east regions. The 
      center of gravity of ESV shifted from northwest to southeast. Due to the sharp 
      increase of the built-up land from 2010 to 2015, the center of gravity shift 
      rebounded. This study can help policymakers better understand the trade-offs between 
      land use transformation and ecosystem services driven by urbanization.

TI  - Viscosity-enhanced droplet motion in sealed superhydrophobic capillaries.
LID - 10.1126/sciadv.aba5197 [doi]
LID - eaba5197
AB  - It is well known that an increased viscosity slows down fluid dynamics. Here we show 
      that this intuitive rule is not general and can fail for liquids flowing in confined 
      liquid-repellent systems. A gravity-driven, highly viscous glycerol droplet inside a 
      sealed superhydrophobic capillary is moving more than 10 times faster than a water 
      droplet with three-orders-of-magnitude lower viscosity. Using tracer particles, we 
      show that the low-viscosity droplets are rapidly rotating internally, with flow 
      velocities greatly exceeding the center-of-mass velocity. This is in stark contrast 
      to the faster moving high-viscosity droplets with nearly vanishing internal flows. 
      The anomalous viscosity-enhanced flow is caused by a viscosity-suppressed 
      deformation of the droplet-air interface and a hydro- and aerodynamic coupling 
      between the droplet and the air trapped within the micro/nanostructures (plastron). 
      Our work demonstrates the unexpected role of the plastron in controlling fluid flow 
      beyond the mere reduction in contact area and friction.

AB  - Tropisms, growth-driven responses to environmental stimuli, cause plant organs to 
      respond in space and time and reorient themselves. Classical experiments from nearly 
      a century ago reveal that plant shoots respond to the integrated history of light 
      and gravity stimuli rather than just responding instantaneously. We introduce a 
      temporally non-local response function for the dynamics of shoot growth formulated 
      as an integro-differential equation whose solution allows us to qualitatively 
      reproduce experimental observations associated with intermittent and unsteady 
      stimuli. Furthermore, an analytic solution for the case of a pulse stimulus 
      expresses the response function as a function of experimentally tractable variables, 
      which we calculate for the case of the phototropic response of Arabidopsis 
      hypocotyls. All together, our model enables us to predict tropic responses to 
      time-varying stimuli, manifested in temporal integration phenomena, and sets the 
      stage for the incorporation of additional effects such as multiple stimuli, 
      gravitational sagging, etc.

TI  - A geometry- and muscle-based control architecture for synthesising biological 
      movement.
PG  - 7-37
LID - 10.1007/s00422-020-00856-4 [doi]
AB  - A key problem for biological motor control is to establish a link between an idea of 
      a movement and the generation of a set of muscle-stimulating signals that lead to 
      the movement execution. The number of signals to generate is thereby larger than the 
      body's mechanical degrees of freedom in which the idea of the movement may be easily 
      expressed, as the movement is actually executed in this space. A mathematical 
      formulation that provides a solving link is presented in this paper in the form of a 
      layered, hierarchical control architecture. It is meant to synthesise a wide range 
      of complex three-dimensional muscle-driven movements. The control architecture 
      consists of a 'conceptional layer', where the movement is planned, a 'structural 
      layer', where the muscles are stimulated, and between both an additional 
      'transformational layer', where the muscle-joint redundancy is resolved. We 
      demonstrate the operativeness by simulating human stance and squatting in a 
      three-dimensional digital human model (DHM). The DHM considers 20 angular DoFs and 
      36 Hill-type muscle-tendon units (MTUs) and is exposed to gravity, while its feet 
      contact the ground via reversible stick-slip interactions. The control architecture 
      continuously stimulates all MTUs ('structural layer') based on a high-level, 
      torque-based task formulation within its 'conceptional layer'. Desired states of 
      joint angles (postural plan) are fed to two mid-level joint controllers in the 
      'transformational layer'. The 'transformational layer' communicates with the 
      biophysical structures in the 'structural layer' by providing direct MTU stimulation 
      contributions and further input signals for low-level MTU controllers. Thereby, the 
      redundancy of the MTU stimulations with respect to the joint angles is resolved, 
      i.e. a link between plan and execution is established, by exploiting some properties 
      of the biophysical structures modelled. The resulting joint torques generated by the 
      MTUs via their moment arms are fed back to the conceptional layer, closing the 
      high-level control loop. Within our mathematical formulations of the Jacobian 
      matrix-based layer transformations, we identify the crucial information for the 
      redundancy solution to be the muscle moment arms, the stiffness relations of muscle 
      and tendon tissue within the muscle model, and the length-stimulation relation of 
      the muscle activation dynamics. The present control architecture allows the 
      straightforward feeding of conceptional movement task formulations to MTUs. With 
      this approach, the problem of movement planning is eased, as solely the mechanical 
      system has to be considered in the conceptional plan.

TI  - Computation of egomotion in the macaque cerebellar vermis.
PG  - 174-82
LID - 10.1007/s12311-009-0147-z [doi]
AB  - The nodulus and uvula (lobules X and IX of the vermis) receive mossy fibers from 
      both vestibular afferents and vestibular nuclei neurons and are thought to play a 
      role in spatial orientation. Their properties relate to a sensory ambiguity of the 
      vestibular periphery: otolith afferents respond identically to translational 
      (inertial) accelerations and changes in orientation relative to gravity. Based on 
      theoretical and behavioral evidence, this sensory ambiguity is resolved using 
      rotational cues from the semicircular canals. Recordings from the cerebellar cortex 
      have identified a neural correlate of the brain's ability to resolve this ambiguity 
      in the simple spike activities of nodulus/uvula Purkinje cells. This computation, 
      which likely involves the cerebellar circuitry and its reciprocal connections with 
      the vestibular nuclei, results from a remarkable convergence of spatially- and 
      temporally-aligned otolith-driven and semicircular canal-driven signals. Such 
      convergence requires a spatio-temporal transformation of head-centered canal-driven 
      signals into an estimate of head reorientation relative to gravity. This signal must 
      then be subtracted from the otolith-driven estimate of net acceleration to compute 
      inertial motion. At present, Purkinje cells in the nodulus/uvula appear to encode 
      the output of this computation. However, how the required spatio-temporal matching 
      takes place within the cerebellar circuitry and what role complex spikes play in 
      spatial orientation and disorientation remains unknown. In addition, the role of 
      visual cues in driving and/or modifying simple and complex spike activity, a process 
      potentially critical for long-term adaptation, constitutes another important 
      direction for future studies.

AB  - Collective motion is found at all scales in biological and artificial systems, and 
      extensive research is devoted to describing the interplay between interactions and 
      external cues in collective dynamics. Magnetotactic bacteria constitute a remarkable 
      example of living organisms for which motion can be easily controlled remotely. 
      Here, we report a new type of collective motion where a uniform distribution of 
      magnetotactic bacteria is rendered unstable by a magnetic field. A new state of 
      "bacterial magneto-convection" results, wherein bacterial plumes emerge 
      spontaneously perpendicular to an interface and develop into self-sustained flow 
      convection cells. While there are similarities to gravity driven bioconvection and 
      the Rayleigh-Bénard instability, these rely on a density mismatch between layers of 
      the fluids. Remarkably, here no external forces are applied on the fluid and the 
      magnetic field only exerts an external torque aligning magnetotactic bacteria with 
      the field. Using a theoretical model based on hydrodynamic singularities, we capture 
      quantitatively the instability and the observed long-time growth. Bacterial 
      magneto-convection represents a new class of collective behaviour resulting only 
      from the balance between hydrodynamic interactions and external alignment.

AB  - The downward movement of the bubble-texture in a glass of Guinness beer is a 
      fascinating fluid flow driven by the buoyant force of a large number of 
      small-diameter bubbles. This texture motion is a frequently observed phenomenon on 
      pub tables. The physical mechanism of the texture-formation has been discussed 
      previously, but inconsistencies exist between these studies. We performed 
      experiments on the bubble distribution in Guinness poured in an inclined container, 
      and observed how the texture forms. We also report the texture-formation in 
      controllable experiments using particle suspensions with precisely specified 
      diameters and volume-concentrations. Our specific measurement methods based on 
      laser-induced-fluorescence provide details of the spatio-temporal profile of the 
      liquid phase velocity. The hydrodynamic condition for the texture-formation is 
      analogous to the critical point of the roll-wave instability in a fluid film, which 
      can be commonly observed in water films sliding downhill on a rainy day. Here, we 
      identify the critical condition for the texture-formation and conclude that the 
      roll-wave instability of the gravity current is responsible for the 
      texture-formation in a glass of Guinness beer.

TI  - Applications of gravity models to evaluate and forecast US international air freight 
      markets post-GFC.
LID - 10.1016/j.tranpol.2020.04.004 [doi]
AB  - In addition to being the world's largest economy, the United States (US) has been 
      the foremost driver of consumer spending, free trade and open skies policies. 
      Trade-driven economic growth and air freight markets have been commonly linked in 
      air transport research. Despite increased security after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, 
      international air imports to the US has continued to grow at a rate faster than 
      consumer spending. This paper aims to evaluate whether gravity models are robust 
      enough to forecast and accurately account for substantial economic shocks such as 
      the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). Our research suggests that US demand for air 
      freight is highly sensitive to transport costs, competition from sea freight and 
      consumer spending patterns of perishable, low value and high value commodities 
      across the 19 commodity groups examined, rather than manufacturing income or factors 
      associated with product origin, which is all the more interesting in the context of 
      the recent protectionist rhetoric of the US administration.

TI  - Phase-conjugate mirror for water waves driven by the Faraday instability.
PG  - 8809-8814
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1818742116 [doi]
AB  - The Faraday instability appears on liquid baths submitted to vertical oscillations 
      above a critical value. The pattern of standing ripples at half the vibrating 
      frequency that results from this parametric forcing is usually shaped by the 
      boundary conditions imposed by the enclosing receptacle. Here, we show that the time 
      modulation of the medium involved in the Faraday instability can act as a 
      phase-conjugate mirror--a fact which is hidden in the extensively studied case of 
      the boundary-driven regime. We first demonstrate the complete analogy with the 
      equations governing its optical counterpart. We then use water baths combining 
      shallow and deep areas of arbitrary shapes to spatially localize the Faraday 
      instability. We give experimental evidence of the ability of the Faraday instability 
      to generate counterpropagating phase-conjugated waves for any propagating signal 
      wave. The canonical geometries of a point and plane source are implemented. We also 
      verify that Faraday-based phase-conjugate mirrors hold the genuine property of being 
      shape independent. These results show that a periodic modulation of the effective 
      gravity can perform time-reversal operations on monochromatic propagating water 
      waves, with a remarkable efficiency compared with wave manipulation in other fields 
      of physics.

AB  - The impact of different feed waters in terms of eukaryotic populations and organic 
      carbon content on the biofilm structure formation and permeate flux during 
      Gravity-Driven Membrane (GDM) filtration was investigated in this study. GDM 
      filtration was performed at ultra-low pressure (65 mbar) in dead-end mode without 
      control of the biofilm formation. Different feed waters were tested (River water, 
      pre-treated river water, lake water, and tap water) and varied with regard to their 
      organic substrate content and their predator community. River water was manipulated 
      either by chemically inhibiting all eukaryotes or by filtering out macrozoobenthos 
      (metazoan organisms). The structure of the biofilm was characterized at the meso- 
      and micro-scale using Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and Confocal Laser Scanning 
      Microscopy (CLSM), respectively. Based on Total Organic Carbon (TOC) measurements, 
      the river waters provided the highest potential for bacterial growth whereas tap 
      water had the lowest. An increasing content in soluble and particulate organic 
      substrate resulted in increasing biofilm accumulation on membrane surface. However, 
      enhanced biofilm accumulation did not result in lower flux values and permeate flux 
      was mainly influenced by the structure of the biofilm. Metazoan organisms (in 
      particular nematodes and oligochaetes) built-up protective habitats, which resulted 
      in the formation of open and spatially heterogeneous biofilms composed of biomass 
      patches. In the absence of predation by metazoan organisms, a flat and compact 
      biofilm developed. It is concluded that the activity of metazoan organisms in 
      natural river water and its impact on biofilm structure balances the detrimental 
      effect of a high biofilm accumulation, thus allowing for a broader application of 
      GDM filtration. Finally, our results suggest that for surface waters with high 
      particulate organic carbon (POC) content, the use of worms is suitable to enhance 
      POC removal before ultrafiltration units.

AB  - Internal gravity waves are generated as adjustment radiation whenever a sudden 
      change in forcing causes the atmosphere to depart from its large-scale balanced 
      state. Such a forcing anomaly occurs during a solar eclipse, when the Moon's shadow 
      cools part of the Earth's surface. The resulting atmospheric gravity waves are 
      associated with pressure and temperature perturbations, which in principle are 
      detectable both at the surface and aloft. In this study, surface pressure and 
      temperature data from two UK sites at Reading and Lerwick are examined for 
      eclipse-driven gravity wave perturbations during the 20 March 2015 solar eclipse 
      over northwest Europe. Radiosonde wind data from the same two sites are also 
      analysed using a moving parcel analysis method, to determine the periodicities of 
      the waves aloft. On this occasion, the perturbations both at the surface and aloft 
      are found not to be confidently attributable to eclipse-driven gravity waves. We 
      conclude that the complex synoptic weather conditions over the UK at the time of 
      this particular eclipse helped to mask any eclipse-driven gravity waves.This article 
      is part of the themed issue 'Atmospheric effects of solar eclipses stimulated by the 
      2015 UK eclipse'.

AB  - Animal movements are typically driven by areas of supply and demand for animal 
      products and by the seasonality of production and demand. As animals can potentially 
      spread infectious diseases, disease prevention can benefit from a better 
      understanding of the factors influencing movements patterns in space and time. In 
      Mauritania, an important cultural event, called the Tabaski (Aïd el Kebir) strongly 
      affects timing and structure of movements, and due to the arid and semi-arid 
      climatic conditions, the season can also influence movement patterns. In order to 
      better characterize the animal movements patterns, a survey was carried out in 2014, 
      and those data were analysed here using social network analysis (SNA) metrics and 
      used to train predictive gravity models. More specifically, we aimed to contrast the 
      movements structure by ruminant species, season (Tabaski vs. Non-Tabaski) and mode 
      of transport (truck vs. foot). The networks differed according to the species, and 
      to the season, with a changed proportion of truck vs. foot movements. The gravity 
      models were able to predict the probability of a movement link between two locations 
      with moderate to good accuracy (AUC ranging from 0.76 to 0.97), according to 
      species, seasons, and mode of transport, but we failed to predict the traded volume 
      of those trade links. The significant predictor variables of a movement link were 
      the human and sheep population at the source and origin, and the distance separating 
      the locations. Though some improvements would be needed to predict traded volumes 
      and better account for the barriers to mobility, the results provide useful 
      predictions to inform epidemiological models in space and time, and, upon external 
      validation, could be useful to predict movements at a larger regional scale.

LID - 726
AB  - Human mobility is a primary driver of infectious disease spread. However, existing 
      data is limited in availability, coverage, granularity, and timeliness. Data-driven 
      forecasts of disease dynamics are crucial for decision-making by health officials 
      and private citizens alike. In this work, we focus on a machine-learned anonymized 
      mobility map (hereon referred to as AMM) aggregated over hundreds of millions of 
      smartphones and evaluate its utility in forecasting epidemics. We factor AMM into a 
      metapopulation model to retrospectively forecast influenza in the USA and Australia. 
      We show that the AMM model performs on-par with those based on commuter surveys, 
      which are sparsely available and expensive. We also compare it with gravity and 
      radiation based models of mobility, and find that the radiation model's performance 
      is quite similar to AMM and commuter flows. Additionally, we demonstrate our model's 
      ability to predict disease spread even across state boundaries. Our work contributes 
      towards developing timely infectious disease forecasting at a global scale using 
      human mobility datasets expanding their applications in the area of infectious 
      disease epidemiology.

TI  - High-Temperature Performance Evaluation of Asphaltenes-Modified Asphalt Binders.
LID - 10.3390/molecules25153326 [doi]
LID - 3326
AB  - Asphalt binder comprises four main fractions-asphaltenes (A), saturates (S), 
      aromatics (A), and resins (R)-referred to as "SARA". Asphaltenes plays an important 
      role in determining the linear viscoelastic behavior of asphalt binders. In this 
      research, asphaltenes are added as a distinct modifier to improve the performance 
      properties of asphalt binder. The modified binders are aged using a rolling thin 
      film oven. A dynamic shear rheometer is then used to measure the rheological 
      properties of the binders at high temperatures. Changes in the chemical composition 
      of the modified binders are also studied through the determination of SARA 
      fractions, using precipitation and gravity-driven chromatography methods. The 
      rheological results show that asphaltenes improve the stiffness and elasticity of 
      asphalt binder. It is also shown that the addition of asphaltenes raises the high 
      Performance grade (PG) temperature of the asphalt binder, with every 6% of 
      asphaltenes added resulting in a one-interval increase in high PG temperature grade. 
      SARA analysis shows that the increase in polar fraction content due to the addition 
      of asphaltenes causes the stiffness, elasticity, and viscosity of asphalt binders to 
      increase. The results indicate that asphaltenes are an effective yet inexpensive 
      additive to improve asphalt binder properties at high temperatures.

TI  - Posture Dynamic Modeling and Stability Analysis of a Magnetic Driven Dual-Spin 
      Spherical Capsule Robot.
LID - 10.3390/mi12030238 [doi]
LID - 238
AB  - In order to realize the intervention operation in the unstructured and ample 
      environments such as stomach and colon, a dual-spin spherical capsule robot (DSCR) 
      driven by pure magnetic torque generated by the universal rotating magnetic field 
      (URMF) is proposed. The coupled magnetic torque, the viscoelastic friction torque, 
      and the gravity torque were analyzed. Furthermore, the posture dynamic model 
      describing the electric-magnetic-mechanical-liquid coupling dynamic behavior of the 
      DSCR in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract was established. This model is a 
      second-order periodic variable coefficient dynamics equation, which should be 
      regarded as an extension of the Lagrange case for the dual-spin body system under 
      the fixed-point motion, since the external torques were applied. Based on the 
      Floquet-Lyapunov theory, the stability domain of the DSCR for the asymptotically 
      stable motion and periodic motion were obtained by investigating the influence of 
      the angular velocity of the URMF, the magnetic induction intensity, and the centroid 
      deviation. Research results show that the DSCR can realize three kinds of motion, 
      which are asymptotically stable motion, periodic motion, and chaotic motion, 
      according to the distribution of the system characteristic multipliers. Moreover, 
      the posture stability of the DSCR can be improved by increasing the angular velocity 
      of the URMF and reducing the magnetic induction intensity.

TI  - A Novel Clinical-Driven Design for Robotic Hand Rehabilitation: Combining Sensory 
      Training, Effortless Setup, and Large Range of Motion in a Palmar Device.
PG  - 748196

LID - 748196
AB  - Neurorehabilitation research suggests that not only high training intensity, but 
      also somatosensory information plays a fundamental role in the recovery of stroke 
      patients. Yet, there is currently a lack of easy-to-use robotic solutions for 
      sensorimotor hand rehabilitation. We addressed this shortcoming by developing a 
      novel clinical-driven robotic hand rehabilitation device, which is capable of fine 
      haptic rendering, and that supports physiological full flexion/extension of the 
      fingers while offering an effortless setup. Our palmar design, based on a 
      parallelogram coupled to a principal revolute joint, introduces the following 
      novelties: (1) While allowing for an effortless installation of the user's hand, it 
      offers large range of motion of the fingers (full extension to 180° flexion). (2) 
      The kinematic design ensures that all fingers are supported through the full range 
      of motion and that the little finger does not lose contact with the finger support 
      in extension. (3) We took into consideration that a handle is usually comfortably 
      grasped such that its longitudinal axis runs obliquely from the metacarpophalangeal 
      joint of the index finger to the base of the hypothenar eminence. (4) The fingertip 
      path was optimized to guarantee physiologically correct finger movements for a large 
      variety of hand sizes. Moreover, the device possesses a high mechanical 
      transparency, which was achieved using a backdrivable cable transmission. The 
      transparency was further improved with the implementation of friction and gravity 
      compensation. In a test with six healthy participants, the root mean square of the 
      human-robot interaction force was found to remain as low as 1.37 N in a dynamic 
      task. With its clinical-driven design and easy-to-use setup, our robotic device for 
      hand sensorimotor rehabilitation has the potential for high clinical acceptance, 
      applicability and effectiveness.

PG  - eaat9700
LID - 10.1126/sciadv.aat9700 [doi]
LID - eaat9700
AB  - The southeastern flank of Etna volcano slides into the Ionian Sea at rates of 
      centimeters per year. The prevailing understanding is that pressurization of the 
      magmatic system, and not gravitational forces, controls flank movement, although 
      this has also been proposed. So far, it has not been possible to separate between 
      these processes, because no data on offshore deformation were available until we 
      conducted the first long-term seafloor displacement monitoring campaign from April 
      2016 until July 2017. Unprecedented seafloor geodetic data reveal a >4-cm slip along 
      the offshore extension of a fault related to flank kinematics during one 8-day-long 
      event in May 2017, while displacement on land peaked at ~4 cm at the coast. As 
      deformation increases away from the magmatic system, the bulk of Mount Etna's 
      present continuous deformation must be driven by gravity while being further 
      destabilized by magma dynamics. We cannot exclude flank movement to evolve into 
      catastrophic collapse, implying that Etna's flank movement poses a much greater 
      hazard than previously thought. The hazard of flank collapse might be underestimated 
      at other coastal and ocean island volcanoes, where the dynamics of submerged flanks 
      are unknown.

AB  - Humans, like all organisms, have evolved to survive in specific environments, while 
      some elect or are forced to live and work in extreme environments. Understanding 
      cognition as it relates to environmental conditions, we use 4E cognition as a 
      framework to explore creativity in extreme environments. Our paper examines space 
      arts as a case study through the history, present practices, and future possible 
      arts in the context of humans beyond the Kármán boundary of the Earth's atmosphere. 
      We develop a proposed taxonomy of space arts, based on prior taxonomies, and provide 
      specific exemplars of space art developed by artists in space or for use by 
      astronauts in space. Using examples of space art since the birth of the space age, 
      we discuss (1) how human survival in extreme environments requires investment in the 
      space arts, driven by consideration of various biopsychosocial factors and (2) how 
      new scientific and engineering discoveries; such as the detection of air current 
      patterns with paper airplanes in zero gravity, could be consequences or examples of 
      creative thinking driven by artists in the various types of space art. We conclude 
      by discussing possible benefits of space art, future research applications, and 
      advocate that all space actors, government or private, involve artists in all 
      projects beyond the Kármán Boundary of the Earth's atmosphere.

      using gravity-driven cell aggregation and balanced droplet dispensing.

AB  - This paper presents a spheroid chip in which three-dimensional (3D) tumor spheroids 
      are not only formed by gravity-driven cell aggregation but also cultured at the 
      perfusion rates controlled by balanced droplet dispensing without fluidic pumps. The 
      previous spheroid chips require additional off-chip processes of spheroid formation 
      and extraction as well as bulky components of fluidic pumps. However, the present 
      spheroid chip, where autonomous medium droplet dispensers are integrated on a well 
      array, achieves the on-chip 3D tumor spheroid formation and perfusion culture using 
      simple structure without bulky fluidic pumps. In the experimental study, we 
      demonstrated that the spheroid chip successfully forms 3D tumor spheroids in the 
      wide diameter range of 220 μm-3.2 mm (uniformity > 90%) using H358, H23, and A549 
      non-small cell lung cancer cells. At the pump-less perfusion culture 
      (Q = 0.1-0.3 μl/min) of spheroids, the number of H358 cells in the spheroid 
      increased up to 50% from the static culture (Q = 0 μl/min) and the viability of the 
      cultured cells also increased about 10%. Therefore, we experimentally verified that 
      the perfusion environment created by the spheroid chip offers a favourable condition 
      to the spheroids with high increase rate and viability. The present chip achieves 
      on-chip 3D tumor spheroid formation and pump-less perfusion culture with simple 
      structure, thereby exhibiting potential for use in integrated in-vivo-like cell 
      culture systems.

TI  - Prospects for comparison of matter and antimatter gravitation with ALPHA-g.
LID - 10.1098/rsta.2017.0265 [doi]
LID - 20170265
AB  - The ALPHA experiment has recently entered an expansion phase of its experimental 
      programme, driven in part by the expected benefits of conducting experiments in the 
      framework of the new AD + ELENA antiproton facility at CERN. With antihydrogen 
      trapping now a routine operation in the ALPHA experiment, the collaboration is 
      leading progress towards precision atomic measurements on trapped antihydrogen 
      atoms, with the first excitation of the 1S-2S transition and the first measurement 
      of the antihydrogen hyperfine spectrum (Ahmadi et al. 2017 Nature541, 506-510 
      (doi:10.1038/nature21040); Nature548, 66-69 (doi:10.1038/nature23446)). We are 
      building on these successes to extend our physics programme to include a measurement 
      of antimatter gravitation. We plan to expand a proof-of-principle method (Amole et 
      al. 2013 Nat. Commun.4, 1785 (doi:10.1038/ncomms2787)), first demonstrated in the 
      original ALPHA apparatus, and perform a precise measurement of antimatter 
      gravitational acceleration with the aim of achieving a test of the weak equivalence 
      principle at the 1% level. The design of this apparatus has drawn from a growing 
      body of experience on the simulation and verification of antihydrogen orbits 
      confined within magnetic-minimum atom traps. The new experiment, ALPHA-g, will be an 
      additional atom-trapping apparatus located at the ALPHA experiment with the 
      intention of measuring antihydrogen gravitation.This article is part of the Theo 
      Murphy meeting issue 'Antiproton physics in the ELENA era'.

AB  - Recent outbreaks caused by coronaviruses and their supposed potential fecal-oral 
      transmission highlight the need for understanding the survival of infectious 
      coronavirus in domestic sewers. To date, the survivability and decay of 
      coronaviruses were predominately studied using small volumes of wastewater (normally 
      5-30 mL) in vials (in-vial tests). However, real sewers are more complicated than 
      bulk wastewater (wastewater matrix only), in particular the presence of sewer 
      biofilms and different operational conditions. This study investigated the decay of 
      infectious human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) and feline infectious peritonitis 
      virus (FIPV), two typical surrogate coronaviruses, in laboratory-scale reactors 
      mimicking the gravity (GS, gravity-driven sewers) and rising main sewers (RM, 
      pressurized sewers) with and without sewer biofilms. The in-sewer decay of both 
      coronaviruses was greatly enhanced in comparison to those reported in bulk 
      wastewater through in-vial tests. 99% of HCoV-229E and FIPV decayed within 2 h under 
      either GS or RM conditions with biofilms, in contrast to 6-10 h without biofilms. 
      There is limited difference in the decay of HCoV and FIPV in reactors operated as RM 
      or GS, with the T(90) and T(99) difference of 7-10 min and 14-20 min, respectively. 
      The decay of both coronaviruses in sewer biofilm reactors can be simulated by 
      biphasic first-order kinetic models, with the first-order rate constant 2-4 times 
      higher during the first phase than the second phase. The decay of infectious HCoV 
      and FIPV was significantly faster in the reactors with sewer biofilms than in the 
      reactors without biofilms, suggesting an enhanced decay of these surrogate viruses 
      due to the presence of biofilms and related processes. The mechanism of biofilms in 
      virus adsorption and potential inactivation remains unclear and requires future 
      investigations. The results indicate that the survivability of infectious 
      coronaviruses detected using bulk wastewater overestimated the infectivity risk of 
      coronavirus during wastewater transportations in sewers or the downstream treatment.

TI  - Influence of Microgravity on Apoptosis in Cells, Tissues, and Other Systems In Vivo 
      and In Vitro.
LID - 10.3390/ijms21249373 [doi]
LID - 9373
AB  - All life forms have evolved under the constant force of gravity on Earth and 
      developed ways to counterbalance acceleration load. In space, shear forces, 
      buoyance-driven convection, and hydrostatic pressure are nullified or strongly 
      reduced. When subjected to microgravity in space, the equilibrium between cell 
      architecture and the external force is disturbed, resulting in changes at the 
      cellular and sub-cellular levels (e.g., cytoskeleton, signal transduction, membrane 
      permeability, etc.). Cosmic radiation also poses great health risks to astronauts 
      because it has high linear energy transfer values that evoke complex DNA and other 
      cellular damage. Space environmental conditions have been shown to influence 
      apoptosis in various cell types. Apoptosis has important functions in morphogenesis, 
      organ development, and wound healing. This review provides an overview of 
      microgravity research platforms and apoptosis. The sections summarize the current 
      knowledge of the impact of microgravity and cosmic radiation on cells with respect 
      to apoptosis. Apoptosis-related microgravity experiments conducted with different 
      mammalian model systems are presented. Recent findings in cells of the immune 
      system, cardiovascular system, brain, eyes, cartilage, bone, gastrointestinal tract, 
      liver, and pancreas, as well as cancer cells investigated under real and simulated 
      microgravity conditions, are discussed. This comprehensive review indicates the 
      potential of the space environment in biomedical research.

AB  - PURPOSE: The Ahmed glaucoma valve (AGV) implant is designed to prevent early 
      postoperative hypotony. There is evidence of variation in hypotony rates in clinical 
      trials which may be due to surgical technique variation, entry site leakage or valve 
      defects from 'over priming'. We describe a simple preimplantation gravity driven 
      test to assess valve function after priming that may reduce hypotony rates. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective case note review. An in vivo flow test of AGVs, 
      based on the gravity driven test was introduced prior to implantation. The onset and 
      offset of flow through the valve was measured by altering the height of a bottle of 
      balanced saline solution. We rejected the AGV, if there was fluid still flowing at 
      10 cm (7 mm Hg) or if there was no flow at 17 cm of water (12 mm Hg). The AGV 
      implantation surgery was without mitomycin C, with a 25G needle entry tract, a 
      corneal or scleral patch graft tube cover and without intracameral viscoelastic. 
      RESULTS: Twenty Ahmed valves were implanted in 16 patients between July 2008 and 
      October 2009. Test failure resulted in four AGV being rejected. The mean 
      preoperative pressure was 29 mm Hg (range, 10-57 mm Hg) and the intraocular pressure 
      (IOP) at 7 days postoperatively was 15 mm Hg (range, 3-52 mm Hg). Hypotony, defined 
      as an IOP of less than 5 mm Hg on two consecutive assessments, was present in two 
      eyes (10%). CONCLUSION: In vivo flow testing is an important safety check for the 
      AGV. There are also other mechanisms after implantation that can cause an unexpected 
      high or low IOP. How to cite this article: Jones E, Alaghband P, Cheng J,

AB  - The pandemic caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has produced a global 
      health calamity that has a profound impact on the way of perceiving the world and 
      everyday lives. This has appeared as the greatest threat of the time for the entire 
      world in terms of its impact on human mortality rate and many other societal fronts 
      or driving forces whose estimations are yet to be known. Therefore, this study 
      focuses on the most crucial sectors that are severely impacted due to the COVID-19 
      pandemic, in particular reference to India. Considered based on their direct link to 
      a country's overall economy, these sectors include economic and financial, 
      educational, healthcare, industrial, power and energy, oil market, employment, and 
      environment. Based on available data about the pandemic and the above-mentioned 
      sectors, as well as forecasted data about COVID-19 spreading, four inclusive 
      mathematical models, namely-exponential smoothing, linear regression, Holt, and 
      Winters, are used to analyse the gravity of the impacts due to this COVID-19 
      outbreak which is also graphically visualized. All the models are tested using data 
      such as COVID-19 infection rate, number of daily cases and deaths, GDP of India, and 
      unemployment. Comparing the obtained results, the best prediction model is 
      presented. This study aims to evaluate the impact of this pandemic on country-driven 
      sectors and recommends some strategies to lessen these impacts on a country's 
      economy.

AB  - In this study, a polydopamine (PDA) and polyethyleneimine (PEI)-assisted approach 
      was developed to generate well-distributed PDA/PEI/silver (PDA/PEI/Ag) nanocomplexes 
      on the surfaces of commercial cellulose filter papers to achieve substantial 
      bacterial reduction under gravity-driven filtration. PDA can bind to cellulose paper 
      and act as a reducer to produce silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), while PEI can react 
      with oxidative dopamine and act as a dispersant to avoid the aggregation of AgNPs. 
      The successful immobilization of PDA/PEI/Ag nanocomplexes was confirmed by scanning 
      electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier transform infrared 
      spectroscopy (FTIR). Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Escherichia coli (E. 
      coli) were used as pathogen models to test the efficacy of the PDA/PEI/Ag 
      nanocomplex-incorporated filter papers. The PDA/PEI/Ag nanocomplex-incorporated 
      filter papers provided a substantial bacterial removal of up to 99% by simple 
      gravity filtration. This work may be useful to develop a feasible industrial 
      production process for the integration of biocidal AgNPs into cellulose filter paper 
      and is recommended as a local-condition water-treatment technology to treat 
      microbial-contaminated drinking water.

AB  - A lack of gravity experienced during space flight has been shown to have profound 
      effects on human physiology including muscle atrophy, reductions in bone density and 
      immune function, and endocrine disorders. At present, these physiological changes 
      present major obstacles to long-term space missions. What is not clear is which 
      pathophysiological disruptions reflect changes at the cellular level versus changes 
      that occur due to the impact of weightlessness on the entire body. This review 
      focuses on current research investigating the impact of microgravity at the cellular 
      level including cellular morphology, proliferation, and adhesion. As direct research 
      in space is currently cost prohibitive, we describe here the use of microgravity 
      simulators for studies at the cellular level. Such instruments provide valuable 
      tools for cost-effective research to better discern the impact of weightlessness on 
      cellular function. Despite recent advances in understanding the relationship between 
      extracellular forces and cell behavior, very little is understood about cellular 
      biology and mechanotransduction under microgravity conditions. This review will 
      examine recent insights into the impact of simulated microgravity on cell biology 
      and how this technology may provide new insight into advancing our understanding of 
      mechanically driven biology and disease.

TI  - Towards bedside washing of stored red blood cells: a prototype of a simple apparatus 
      based on microscale sedimentation in normal gravity.
PG  - 31-39
LID - 10.1111/vox.12605 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Infusion of by-products of red blood cell (RBC) 
      storage-induced degradation as well as of the residual plasma proteins and the 
      anticoagulant-preservative solution contained in units of stored blood serve no 
      therapeutic purpose and may be harmful to some patients. Here, we describe a 
      prototype of a gravity-driven system for bedside washing of stored RBCs. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: Stored RBCs were diluted to 10% haematocrit (Hct) with normal saline, 
      matching the conventional washing procedure. The dilute RBC suspensions were passed 
      through a column of coiled tubing to allow RBC sedimentation in normal gravity, thus 
      separating them from the washing solution. Washed RBCs were collected using 
      bifurcations located along the tubing. Washing efficiency was quantified by 
      measuring Hct, morphology, deformability, free haemoglobin and total-free protein. 
      RESULTS: The gravity-driven washing system operating at 0·5 ml/min produced washed 
      RBCs with final Hct of 36·7 ± 3·4% (32·3-41·2%, n = 10) and waste Hct of 3·4 ± 0·7% 
      (2·4-4·3%, n = 10), while removing 80% of free haemoglobin and 90% of total-free 
      protein. Washing improved the ability of stored RBCs to perfuse an artificial 
      microvascular network by 20%. The efficiency of washing performed using the 
      gravity-driven system was not significantly different than that of conventional 
      centrifugation. CONCLUSIONS: This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the 
      feasibility of washing stored RBCs using a simple, disposable system with efficiency 
      comparable to that of conventional centrifugation, and thus represents a significant 
      first step towards enabling low-cost washing of stored blood at bedside.

TI  - Entropy Production on the Gravity-Driven Flow with Free Surface Down an Inclined 
      Plane Subjected to Constant Temperature.
LID - 10.3390/e20040293 [doi]
LID - 293
AB  - The long-wave approximation of a falling film down an inclined plane with constant 
      temperature is used to investigate the volumetric averaged entropy production. The 
      velocity and temperature fields are numerically computed by the evolution equation 
      at the deformable free interface. The dynamics of a falling film have an important 
      role in the entropy production. When the layer shows an unstable evolution, the 
      entropy production by fluid friction is much larger than that of the film with a 
      stable flat interface. As the heat transfers actively from the free surface to the 
      ambient air, the temperature gradient inside flowing films becomes large and the 
      entropy generation by heat transfer increases. The contribution of fluid friction on 
      the volumetric averaged entropy production is larger than that of heat transfer at 
      moderate and high viscous dissipation parameters.

LID - 363
AB  - We present a novel mechanism of supersymmetry breaking embeddable in string theory 
      and simultaneously sharing the main advantages of (sequestered) gravity and gauge 
      mediation. It is driven by a Scherk-Schwarz deformation along a compact extra 
      dimension, transverse to a brane stack supporting the supersymmetric extension of 
      the Standard Model. This fixes the magnitude of the gravitino mass, together with 
      that of the gauginos of a bulk gauge group, at a scale as high as [Formula: see 
      text] GeV. Supersymmetry breaking is mediated to the observable sector dominantly by 
      gauge interactions using massive messengers transforming non-trivially under the 
      bulk and Standard Model gauge groups and leading to a neutralino LSP as dark matter 
      candidate. The Higgsino mass [Formula: see text] and soft Higgs-bilinear [Formula: 
      see text] term could be generated at the same order of magnitude as the other soft 
      terms by effective supergravity couplings as in the Giudice-Masiero mechanism.

TI  - The function of the autonomic nervous system during spaceflight.
PG  - 141-51
LID - 10.1007/s10286-015-0285-y [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Despite decades of study, a clear understanding of autonomic nervous 
      system activity in space remains elusive. Differential interpretation of fundamental 
      data has driven divergent theories of sympathetic activation and vasorelaxation. 
      METHODS: This paper will review the available in-flight autonomic and hemodynamic 
      data in an effort to resolve these discrepancies. The NASA NEUROLAB mission, the 
      most comprehensive assessment of autonomic function in microgravity to date, will be 
      highlighted. The mechanisms responsible for altered autonomic activity during 
      spaceflight, which include the effects of hypovolemia, cardiovascular 
      deconditioning, and altered central processing, will be presented. RESULTS: The 
      NEUROLAB experiments demonstrated increased sympathetic activity and impairment of 
      vagal baroreflex function during short-duration spaceflight. Subsequent non-invasive 
      studies of autonomic function during spaceflight have largely reinforced these 
      findings, and provide strong evidence that sympathetic activity is increased in 
      space relative to the supine position on Earth. Others have suggested that 
      microgravity induces a state of relative vasorelaxation and increased vagal activity 
      when compared to upright posture on Earth. These ostensibly disparate theories are 
      not mutually exclusive, but rather directly reflect different pre-flight postural 
      controls. CONCLUSION: When these results are taken together, they demonstrate that 
      the effectual autonomic challenge of spaceflight is small, and represents an 
      orthostatic stress less than that of upright posture on Earth. In-flight 
      countermeasures, including aerobic and resistance exercise, as well short-arm 
      centrifugation, have been successfully deployed to counteract these mechanisms. 
      Despite subtle changes in autonomic activity during spaceflight, underlying 
      neurohumoral mechanisms of the autonomic nervous system remain intact and 
      cardiovascular function remains stable during long-duration flight.

TI  - Role of Surface Gravity Waves in Aquaplanet Ocean Climates.
PG  - e2020MS002202
LID - 10.1029/2020MS002202 [doi]
LID - e2020MS002202
AB  - We present a set of idealized numerical experiments of a solstitial aquaplanet ocean 
      and examine the thermodynamic and dynamic implications of surface gravity waves 
      (SGWs) upon its mean state. The aquaplanet's oceanic circulation is dominated by an 
      equatorial zonal jet and four Ekman driven meridional overturning circulation (MOC) 
      cells aligned with the westerly atmospheric jet streams and easterly trade winds in 
      both hemispheres. Including SGW parameterization (representing modulations of 
      air-sea momentum fluxes, Langmuir circulation, and Stokes-Coriolis force) increases 
      mixed layer vertical momentum diffusivity by ∼40% and dampens surface momentum 
      fluxes by ∼4%. The correspondingly dampened MOC impacts the oceanic density 
      structure to 1 km depth by lessening the large-scale advective transports of heat 
      and salt, freshening the equatorial latitudes (where evaporation minus precipitation 
      [E - P] is negative) and increasing salinity in the subtropics (where E - P is 
      positive) by ∼1%. The midlatitude pycnocline in both hemispheres is deepened by the 
      inclusion of SGWs. Including SGWs into the aquaplanet ocean model acts to increase 
      mixed layer depth by ∼10% (up to 20% in the wintertime in midlatitudes), decrease 
      vertical shear in the upper 200 m and alter local midlatitude buoyancy frequency. 
      Generally, the impacts of SGWs upon the aquaplanet ocean are found to be consistent 
      across cooler and warmer climates. We suggest that the implications of these 
      simulations could be relevant to understanding future projections of SGW climate, 
      exoplanetary oceans, and the dynamics of the Southern Ocean mixed layer.

AB  - A spallation target is one of the three core parts of the accelerator driven 
      subcritical system (ADS), which has already been investigated for decades. Recently, 
      a gravity-driven Dense Granular-flow Target (DGT) is proposed, which consists of a 
      cylindrical hopper and an internal coaxial cylindrical beam pipe. The research on 
      the flow rate and free surface are important for the design of the target whether in 
      Heavy Liquid Metal (HLM) targets or the DGT. In this paper, the relations of flow 
      rate and the geometry of the DGT are investigated. Simulations based on the discrete 
      element method (DEM) implementing on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and 
      experiments are both performed. It is found that the existence of an internal pipe 
      doesn't influence the flow rate when the distance from the bottom of the pipe to 
      orifice is large enough even in a larger system. Meanwhile, snapshots of the free 
      surface formed just below the beam pipe are given. It is observed that the free 
      surface is stable over time. The entire research is meaningful for the design of 
      DGT.

TI  - Nutritional Orthopedics and Space Nutrition as Two Sides of the Same Coin: A Scoping 
      Review.
LID - 10.3390/nu13020483 [doi]
LID - 483
AB  - Since the Moon landing, nutritional research has been charged with the task of 
      guaranteeing human health in space. In addition, nutrition applied to Orthopedics 
      has developed in recent years, driven by the need to improve the efficiency of the 
      treatment path by enhancing the recovery after surgery. As a result, nutritional 
      sciences have specialized into two distinct fields of research: Nutritional 
      Orthopedics and Space Nutrition. The former primarily deals with the nutritional 
      requirements of old patients in hospitals, whereas the latter focuses on the varied 
      food challenges of space travelers heading to deep space. Although they may seem 
      disconnected, they both investigate similar nutritional issues. This scoping review 
      shows what these two disciplines have in common, highlighting the mutual features 
      between (1) pre-operative vs. pre-launch nutritional programs, (2) hospital-based 
      vs. space station nutritional issues, and (3) post-discharge vs. deep space 
      nutritional resilience. PubMed and Google Scholar were used to collect documents 
      published from 1950 to 2020, from which 44 references were selected on Nutritional 
      Orthopedics and 44 on Space Nutrition. Both the orthopedic patient and the astronaut 
      were found to suffer from food insecurity, malnutrition, musculoskeletal involution, 
      flavor/pleasure issues, fluid shifts, metabolic stresses, and isolation/confinement. 
      Both fields of research aid the planning of demand-driven food systems and advanced 
      nutritional approaches, like tailored diets with nutrients of interest (e.g., 
      vitamin D and calcium). The nutritional features of orthopedic patients on Earth and 
      of astronauts in space are undeniably related. Consequently, it is important to 
      initiate close collaborations between orthopedic nutritionists and space experts, 
      with the musculoskeletal-related dedications playing as common fuel.

AB  - FO-ATP synthase (FO) is a rotary motor that converts potential energy from ions, 
      usually protons, moving from high- to low-potential sides of a membrane into torque 
      and rotary motion. Here we propose a mechanism whereby electric fields emanating 
      from the proton entry and exit channels act on asymmetric charge distributions in 
      the c-ring, due to protonated and deprotonated sites, and drive it to rotate. The 
      model predicts a scaling between time-averaged torque and proton motive force, which 
      can be hindered by mutations that adversely affect the channels. The torque created 
      by the c-ring of FO drives the γ-subunit to rotate within the ATP-producing complex 
      (F1) overcoming, with the aid of thermal fluctuations, an opposing torque that rises 
      and falls with angular position. Using the analogy with thermal Brownian motion of a 
      particle in a tilted washboard potential, we compute ATP production rates vs. proton 
      motive force. The latter shows a minimum, needed to drive ATP production, which 
      scales inversely with the number of proton binding sites on the c-ring.

TI  - Control and modulation of canal driven vestibulo-ocular reflex.
PG  - 382-6
AB  - It has been well known that the canal driven vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) is 
      controlled and modulated through the central nervous system by external sensory 
      information (e.g. visual, otolithic and somatosensory inputs) and by mental 
      conditions. Because the origin of retinal image motion exists both in the subjects 
      (eye, head and body motions) and in the external world (object motion), the head 
      motion should be canceled and/or the object should be followed by smooth eye 
      movements. Human has developed a lot of central nervous mechanisms for smooth eye 
      movements (e.g. VOR, optokinetic reflex and smooth pursuit eye movements). These 
      mechanisms are thought to work for the purpose of better seeing. Distinct mechanism 
      will work in appropriate self motion and/or object motion. As the results, whole 
      mechanisms are controlled in a purpose-directed manner. This can be achieved by a 
      self-organizing holistic system. Holistic system is very useful for understanding 
      human oculomotor behavior.

TI  - Dynamic mode decomposition in adaptive mesh refinement and coarsening simulations.
PG  - 1-28
LID - 10.1007/s00366-021-01485-6 [doi]
AB  - Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is a powerful data-driven method used to extract 
      spatio-temporal coherent structures that dictate a given dynamical system. The 
      method consists of stacking collected temporal snapshots into a matrix and mapping 
      the nonlinear dynamics using a linear operator. The classical procedure considers 
      that snapshots possess the same dimensionality for all the observable data. However, 
      this often does not occur in numerical simulations with adaptive mesh 
      refinement/coarsening schemes (AMR/C). This paper proposes a strategy to enable DMD 
      to extract features from observations with different mesh topologies and dimensions, 
      such as those found in AMR/C simulations. For this purpose, the adaptive snapshots 
      are projected onto the same reference function space, enabling the use of 
      snapshot-based methods such as DMD. The present strategy is applied to challenging 
      AMR/C simulations: a continuous diffusion-reaction epidemiological model for 
      COVID-19, a density-driven gravity current simulation, and a bubble rising problem. 
      We also evaluate the DMD efficiency to reconstruct the dynamics and some relevant 
      quantities of interest. In particular, for the SEIRD model and the bubble rising 
      problem, we evaluate DMD's ability to extrapolate in time (short-time future 
      estimates).

AB  - Gravity-sensitive cellular responses are regularly observed in both specialized and 
      nonspecialized cells. One potential mechanism for this sensitivity is a changing 
      viscosity of the intracellular organelles. Here, we report a novel, to our 
      knowledge, viscosity-sensitive molecular rotor based on mesosubstituted 
      boron-dipyrrin used to investigate the response of viscosity of cellular membranes 
      to hypergravity conditions created at the large diameter centrifuge at the European 
      Space Agency Technology Centre. Mouse osteoblastic (MC3T3-E1) and endothelial (human 
      umbilical vein endothelial cell) cell lines were tested, and an increase in 
      viscosity was found with increasing hypergravity loading. This response is thought 
      to be primarily biologically driven, with the potential for a small, instantaneous 
      physical mechanism also contributing to the observed effect. This work provides the 
      first, to our knowledge, quantitative data for cellular viscosity changes under 
      hypergravity, up to 15 × g.

      convective boundary condition. The Boussinesq approximation is applied to simplify 
      the buoyancy term, and similarity transformations are used on the mathematical model 
      of the problem under consideration, to obtain a set of coupled ordinary differential 
      equations. Then the reduced equations are solved explicitly by using homotopy 
      analysis method (HAM). The resulting solutions are investigated for heat transfer 
      effects on velocity and temperature profiles.

TI  - Evolution of vertebrate mechanosensory hair cells and inner ears: toward identifying 
      stimuli that select mutation driven altered morphologies.
PG  - 5-18
LID - 10.1007/s00359-013-0865-z [doi]
AB  - Among the major distance senses of vertebrates, the ear is unique in its complex 
      morphological changes during evolution. Conceivably, these changes enable the ear to 
      adapt toward sensing various physically well-characterized stimuli. This review 
      develops a scenario that integrates sensory cell with organ evolution. We propose 
      that molecular and cellular evolution of the vertebrate hair cells occurred prior to 
      the formation of the vertebrate ear. We previously proposed that the genes driving 
      hair cell differentiation were aggregated in the otic region through developmental 
      re-patterning that generated a unique vertebrate embryonic structure, the otic 
      placode. In agreement with the presence of graviceptive receptors in many vertebrate 
      outgroups, it is likely that the vertebrate ear originally functioned as a simple 
      gravity-sensing organ. Based on the rare occurrence of angular acceleration 
      receptors in vertebrate outgroups, we further propose that the canal system evolved 
      with a more sophisticated ear morphogenesis. This evolving morphogenesis obviously 
      turned the initial otocyst into a complex set of canals and recesses, harboring 
      multiple sensory epithelia each adapted to the acquisition of a specific aspect of a 
      given physical stimulus. As support for this evolutionary progression, we provide 
      several details of the molecular basis of ear development.

AB  - Freshwater biofilms assemble from a pool of rare water column genotypes. Random 
      density fluctuations and temporal species turnover of functionally equivalent 
      potential colonizers result in compositional variability of newly formed biofilm 
      communities. We hypothesized that stronger environmental filtering as induced by 
      enhanced substrate levels might reduce the impact of a locally variable pool of 
      colonizers and instead select for more universal habitat specialists. Our model were 
      heterotrophic biofilms that form on membranes during gravity-driven ultrafiltration 
      of lake water. In four separate experiments, biomass of the cyanobacterium 
      Microcystis was added to the feed water of one set of treatments (BM) and the 
      resulting biofilm communities were compared to unamended controls (CTRL). Biomass 
      addition led to a significant shift of community assembly processes: Replicate BM 
      biofilms were more similar to each other than by chance in 3 of 4 experiments, 
      whereas the opposite was the case for CTRL communities. Moreover, BM communities 
      were more stochastically assembled across experiments from a common 'regional' pool 
      of biofilm colonizers, whereas the composition of CTRL communities was mainly 
      determined by experiment-specific 'local' genotypes. Interestingly, community 
      assembly processes were also related to both, physiology (aerobic vs. anaerobic 
      lifestyle) and the phylogenetic affiliation of biofilm bacteria.

AB  - In this work, the first-ever membrane-based single unit operation that enables 
      gravity driven, on-demand separation of various oil-water mixtures is developed. 
      Using this methodology, the on-demand separation of free oil and water, oil-in-water 
      emulsions, and water-in-oil emulsions is demonstrated, with ≥99.9% separation 
      efficiency. A scaled-up apparatus to separate larger quantities (several liters) of 
      oil-water emulsions is also developed.

TI  - On-chip perivascular niche supporting stemness of patient-derived glioma cells in a 
      serum-free, flowable culture.

AB  - Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and the most aggressive type of 
      primary brain malignancy. Glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs) can migrate in 
      vascular niches within or away from the tumour mass, increasing tumour resistance to 
      treatments and contributing to relapses. To study individual GSC migration and their 
      interactions with the perivasculature of the tumour microenvironment, there is a 
      need to develop a human organotypic in vitro model. Herein, we demonstrated a 
      perivascular niche-on-a-chip, in a serum-free condition with gravity-driven flow, 
      that supported the stemness of patient-derived GSCs and foetal neural stem cells 
      grown in a three-dimensional environment (3D). Endothelial cells from three organ 
      origins, (i) human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hCMEC/D3), (ii) human 
      umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and, (iii) human lung microvascular 
      endothelial cells (HMVEC-L) formed rounded microvessels within the 
      extracellular-matrix integrated microfluidic chip. By optimising cell extraction 
      protocols, systematic studies were performed to evaluate the effects of serum-free 
      media, 3D cell cultures, and the application of gravity-driven flow on the 
      characteristics of endothelial cells and their co-culture with GSCs. Our results 
      showed the maintenance of adherent and tight junction markers of hCMEC/D3 in the 
      serum-free culture and that gravity-driven flow was essential to support adequate 
      viability of both the microvessel and the GSCs in co-culture (>80% viability at day 
      3). Endpoint biological assays showed upregulation of neovascularization-related 
      genes (e.g., angiopoietins, vascular endothelial growth factor receptors) in 
      endothelial cells co-cultured with GSCs in contrast to the neural stem cell 
      reference that showed insignificant changes. The on-chip platform further permitted 
      live-cell imaging of GSC - microvessel interaction, enabling quantitative analysis 
      of GSC polarization and migration. Overall, our comparative genotypic (i.e. qPCR) 
      and phenotypic (i.e. vessel permeability and GSC migration) studies showed that 
      organotypic (brain cancer cells-brain endothelial microvessel) interactions differed 
      from those within non-tissue specific vascular niches of human origin. The 
      development and optimization of this on-chip perivascular niche, in a serum-free 
      flowable culture, could provide the next level of complexity of an in vitro system 
      to study the influence of glioma stem cells on brain endothelium.

AB  - Nitrogen-functionalization is an effective means of improving the catalytic 
      performances of nanozymes. In the present work, plasma-assisted nitrogen 
      modification of nanocolumnar Ni GLAD films was performed using an ammonia plasma, 
      resulting in an improvement in the peroxidase-like catalytic performance of the 
      porous, nanostructured Ni films. The plasma-treated nanozymes were characterized by 
      TEM, SEM, XRD, and XPS, revealing a nitrogen-rich surface composition. Increased 
      surface wettability was observed after ammonia plasma treatment, and the resulting 
      nitrogen-functionalized Ni GLAD films presented dramatically enhanced 
      peroxidase-like catalytic activity. The optimal time for plasma treatment was 
      determined to be 120 s; when used to catalyze the oxidation of the colorimetric 
      substrate TMB in the presence of H2O2, Ni films subjected to 120 s of plasma 
      treatment yielded a much higher maximum reaction velocity (3.7⊆10-8 M/s vs. 2.3⊆10-8 
      M/s) and lower Michaelis-Menten coefficient (0.17 mM vs. 0.23 mM) than pristine Ni 
      films with the same morphology. Additionally, we demonstrate the application of the 
      nanozyme in a gravity-driven, continuous catalytic reaction device. Such a 
      controllable plasma treatment strategy may open a new door toward 
      surface-functionalized nanozymes with improved catalytic performance and potential 
      applications in flow-driven point-of-care devices.

AB  - Modeling of tsunami waves generated by subaerial landslides is important to provide 
      accurate hazard and risk assessments in coastal areas. We perform small-scale 
      laboratory experiments where a tsunami-like wave is generated by the gravity-driven 
      collapse of a subaerial granular column into water. We show that the maximal 
      amplitude reached near-shore by the generated wave in our experiments is linked to 
      the instantaneous immersed volume of grains and to the ultimate immersed deposit. 
      Despite the differences in scale and geometry between our small-scale experiments 
      and the larger-scale geophysical events, a rather good agreement is found between 
      the experimental law and the field data. This approach offers an easy way to 
      estimate the amplitude of paleo-tsunamis.

LID - 10.1073/pnas.1322857111 [doi]
AB  - Interactions between surfaces and particles in aqueous suspension are usually 
      limited to distances smaller than 1 μm. However, in a range of studies from 
      different disciplines, repulsion of particles has been observed over distances of up 
      to hundreds of micrometers, in the absence of any additional external fields. 
      Although a range of hypotheses have been suggested to account for such behavior, the 
      physical mechanisms responsible for the phenomenon still remain unclear. To identify 
      and isolate these mechanisms, we perform detailed experiments on a well-defined 
      experimental system, using a setup that minimizes the effects of gravity and 
      convection. Our experiments clearly indicate that the observed long-range repulsion 
      is driven by a combination of ion exchange, ion diffusion, and diffusiophoresis. We 
      develop a simple model that accounts for our data; this description is expected to 
      be directly applicable to a wide range of systems exhibiting similar long-range 
      forces.

AB  - Colloidal droplets on flat solid substrates commonly leave symmetric ring-like 
      deposits due to coffee-ring flows during evaporation. On inclined substrates, 
      droplet shapes may become asymmetric by gravity. On this basis, it is not clear how 
      their evaporation dynamics and final deposits are changed depending on inclination. 
      Here we explore evaporation and deposition dynamics of colloidal droplets on 
      inclined substrates, mainly by controlling colloidal particle size, substrate 
      inclination, and relative humidity, which are crucial to gravitational intervention 
      and evaporation dynamics. We experimentally investigate two different flows with 
      opposite directions: downward sedimentation flows by gravity ([Formula: see text]) 
      and upward capillary flows by evaporation ([Formula: see text]). We find that the 
      competition of two flows determines the formation of final deposits with a flow 
      speed ratio of [Formula: see text]. Notably, for [Formula: see text] [Formula: see 
      text] 1, evaporation-driven upward flows overwhelm sedimentation-driven downward 
      flows, resulting in accentuated particle movement towards the top ring, which seems 
      to defy gravitational intervention. We suggest a possible explanation for the flow 
      speed dependence of final deposits in evaporating colloidal droplets. This study 
      offers a framework to understand the intervention of inclination to the formation of 
      final deposits and how to overcome the deposit pattern radial asymmetry, achieving 
      symmetric deposit widths from inclined colloidal droplets.

AB  - In this work, we study the problem of onset of thermal convection in a fluid layer 
      overlying a porous layer, the whole system being heated from below. We use 
      Brinkman's model to describe the porous medium and determine the corresponding 
      linear stability equations. The eigenvalue problem is solved by means of a modified 
      Galerkin method. The behavior of the critical wave number and temperature gradient 
      is discussed in terms of the various parameters of the system. We also emphasize the 
      influence of the boundary conditions at the upper surface of the fluid layer; in 
      particular, we examine the role of a free surface whose surface tension is 
      temperature dependent (Marangoni effect). Comparison with earlier works is also 
      made.

LID - 1802033
AB  - Coalescence and splitting of liquid marbles (LMs) are critical for the mixture of 
      precise amount precursors and removal of the wastes in the microliter range. Here, 
      the coalescence and splitting of LMs are realized by a simple gravity-driven impact 
      method and the two processes are systematically investigated to obtain the optimal 
      parameters. The formation, coalescence, and splitting of LMs can be realized 
      on-demand with a designed channel box. By selecting the functional channels on the 
      device, gravity-based fusion and splitting of LMs are performed to mix medium/drugs 
      and remove spent culture medium in a precise manner, thus ensuring that the 
      microenvironment of the cells is maintained under optimal conditions. The LM-based 
      3D stem cell spheroids are demonstrated to possess an approximately threefold of 
      cell viability compared with the conventional spheroid obtained from nonadhesive 
      plates. Delivery of the cell spheroid to a hydrophilic surface results in the in 
      situ respreading of cells and gradual formation of typical 2D cell morphology, which 
      offers the possibility for such spheroid-based stem cell delivery in regenerative 
      medicine.

AB  - We report here a novel pumpless, 96-well plate-based platform for high-throughput 
      dynamic multicellular culture and chemosensitivity evaluation. A gravity-driven flow 
      strategy was developed to generate and sustain the flow rate of culture medium 
      within 10% in the platform's 20 culture chambers. The ability of the platform to 
      generate and sustain the medium flow was demonstrated by computational simulation, 
      flow visualization, and ascertaining the previously known effect of flow-induced 
      shear stress on the stimulated osteogenic differentiation of osteoblasts. The 
      high-throughput utility of the platform was demonstrated by in situ cell staining 
      and high content screening of chemosensitivity assays of multiple myeloma and 
      osteoblast co-cultures. Endpoint characterization and data analyses for all 20 
      culture chambers required less than 1 hour.

TI  - A brief review of bone adaptation to unloading.
PG  - 4-7
LID - 10.1016/S1672-0229(08)60016-9 [doi]
AB  - Weight-bearing bone is constantly adapting its structure and function to mechanical 
      environments. Loading through routine exercises stimulates bone formation and 
      prevents bone loss, but unloading through bed rest and cast immobilization as well 
      as exposure to weightlessness during spaceflight reduces its mass and strength. In 
      order to elucidate the mechanism underlying unloading-driven bone adaptation, 
      ground-based in vitro and in vivo analyses have been conducted using rotating cell 
      culturing and hindlimb suspension. Focusing on gene expression studies in 
      osteoblasts and hindlimb suspension studies, this minireview introduces our recent 
      understanding on bone homeostasis under weightlessness in space. Most of the 
      existing data indicate that unloading has the opposite effects to loading through 
      common signaling pathways. However, a question remains as to whether any pathway 
      unique to unloading (and not to loading) may exist.

TI  - Regional Crustal Vertical Deformation Driven by Terrestrial Water Load Depending on 
      CORS Network and Environmental Loading Data: A Case Study of Southeast Zhejiang.
LID - 10.3390/s21227699 [doi]
LID - 7699
AB  - Monitoring regional terrestrial water load deformation is of great significance to 
      the dynamic maintenance and hydrodynamic study of the regional benchmark framework. 
      In view of the lack of a spatial interpolation method based on the GNSS (Global 
      Navigation Satellite System) elevation time series for obtaining terrestrial water 
      load deformation information, this paper proposes to employ a CORS (Continuously 
      Operating Reference Stations) network combined with environmental loading data, such 
      as ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) atmospheric data, the 
      GLDAS (Global Land Data Assimilation System) hydrological model, and MSLA (Mean Sea 
      Level Anomaly) data. Based on the load deformation theory and spherical harmonic 
      analysis method, we took 38 CORS stations in southeast Zhejiang province as an 
      example and comprehensively determined the vertical deformation of the crust as 
      caused by regional terrestrial water load changes from January 2015 to December 
      2017, and then compared these data with the GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate 
      Experiment) satellite. The results show that the vertical deformation value of the 
      terrestrial water load in southeast Zhejiang, as monitored by the CORS network, can 
      reach a centimeter, and the amplitude changes from -1.8 cm to 2.4 cm. The seasonal 
      change is obvious, and the spatial distribution takes a ladder form from inland to 
      coastal regions. The surface vertical deformation caused by groundwater load changes 
      in the east-west-south-north-central sub-regions show obvious fluctuations from 2015 
      to 2017, and the trends of the five sub-regions are consistent. The amplitude of 
      surface vertical deformation caused by groundwater load change in the west is higher 
      than that in the east. We tested the use of GRACE for the verification of CORS 
      network monitoring results and found a relatively consistent temporal distribution 
      between both data sets after phase delay correction on GRACE, except for in three 
      months-November in 2015, and January and February in 2016. The results show that the 
      comprehensive solution based on the CORS network can effectively improve the 
      monitoring of crustal vertical deformation during regional terrestrial water load 
      change.

      of sugar industry. The gravity purity and the color value of juice are the two most 
      important evaluation indexes in the cane sugar production using the sulphitation 
      clarification method. However, in the actual operation, the measurement of these two 
      indexes is usually obtained by offline experimental titration, which makes it 
      impossible to timely adjust the system indicators. A data-driven modeling based on 
      kernel extreme learning machine is proposed to predict the gravity purity of juice 
      and the color value of clear juice. The model parameters are optimized by particle 
      swarm optimization. Experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness and 
      superiority of the modeling method. Compared with BP neural network, radial basis 
      neural network, and support vector machine, the model has a good performance, which 
      proves the reliability of the model.

TI  - Shifting Focus: From Hydration for Performance to Hydration for Health.

AB  - Over the past 10 years, literature on hydration biomarkers has evolved considerably 
      - from (de)hydration assessment towards a more global definition of biomarkers of 
      hydration in daily life. This shift in thinking about hydration markers was largely 
      driven by investigating the differences that existed between otherwise healthy 
      individuals whose habitual, ad-libitum drinking habits differ, and by identifying 
      physiological changes in low-volume drinkers who subsequently increase their water 
      intake. Aside from obvious differences in urinary volume and concentration, a 
      growing body of evidence is emerging that links differences in fluid intake with 
      small, but biologically significant, differences in vasopressin (copeptin), 
      glomerular filtration rate, and markers of metabolic dysfunction or disease. Taken 
      together, these pieces of the puzzle begin to form a picture of how much water 
      intake should be considered adequate for health, and represent a shifting focus from 
      hydration for performance, toward hydration for health outcomes. This narrative 
      review outlines the key areas of research in which the global hydration process - 
      including water intake, urinary hydration markers, and vasopressin - has been 
      associated with health outcomes, focusing on kidney and metabolic endpoints. It will 
      also provide a commentary on how various hydration biomarkers may be used in 
      hydration for health assessment. Finally, if adequate water intake can play a role 
      in maintaining health, how might we tell if we are drinking enough? Urine output is 
      easily measured, and can take into account differences in daily physical activity, 
      climate, dietary solute load, and other factors that influence daily water needs. 
      Today, targets have been proposed for urine osmolality, specific gravity, and color 
      that may be used by researchers, clinicians, and individuals as simple indicators of 
      optimal hydration. However, there remain a large number of incomplete or unanswered 
      research questions regarding the relationships between water intake, hydration, 
      vasopressin, and health outcomes. Thus, this emerging field represents an excellent 
      opportunity, particularly for young researchers, to develop relevant and novel lines 
      of research.

AB  - Travertine crystal growth ripples are used to reconstruct the early hydraulic 
      history of the Anio Novus aqueduct of ancient Rome. These crystalline morphologies 
      deposited within the aqueduct channel record the hydraulic history of gravity-driven 
      turbulent flow at the time of Roman operation. The wavelength, amplitude, and 
      steepness of these travertine crystal growth ripples indicate that large-scale 
      sustained aqueduct flows scaled directly with the thickness of the aqueous viscous 
      sublayer. Resulting critical shear Reynolds numbers are comparable with those 
      reconstructed from heat/mass transfer crystalline ripples formed in other natural 
      and engineered environments. This includes sediment transport in rivers, lakes, and 
      oceans, chemical precipitation and dissolution in caves, and melting and freezing in 
      ice. Where flow depth and perimeter could be reconstructed from the distribution and 
      stratigraphy of the travertine within the Anio Novus aqueduct, flow velocity and 
      rate have been quantified by deriving roughness-flow relationships that are 
      independent of water temperature. More generally, under conditions of near-constant 
      water temperature and kinematic viscosity within the Anio Novus aqueduct channel, 
      the travertine crystal growth ripple wavelengths increased with decreasing flow 
      velocity, indicating that systematic changes took place in flow rate during 
      travertine deposition. This study establishes that travertine crystal growth ripples 
      such as those preserved in the Anio Novus provide a sensitive record of past 
      hydraulic conditions, which can be similarly reconstructed from travertine deposited 
      in other ancient water conveyance and storage systems around the world.

TI  - An Implanted Vestibular Prosthesis Improves Spatial Orientation in Animals with 
      Severe Vestibular Damage.

AB  - Gravity is a pervasive environmental stimulus, and accurate graviception is required 
      for optimal spatial orientation and postural stability. The primary graviceptors are 
      the vestibular organs, which include angular velocity (semicircular canals) and 
      linear acceleration (otolith organs) sensors. Graviception is degraded in patients 
      with vestibular damage, resulting in spatial misperception and imbalance. Since 
      minimal therapy is available for these patients, substantial effort has focused on 
      developing a vestibular prosthesis or vestibular implant (VI) that reproduces 
      information normally provided by the canals (since reproducing otolith function is 
      very challenging technically). Prior studies demonstrated that angular eye velocity 
      responses could be driven by canal VI-mediated angular head velocity information, 
      but it remains unknown whether a canal VI could improve spatial perception and 
      posture since these behaviors require accurate estimates of angular head position in 
      space relative to gravity. Here, we tested the hypothesis that a canal VI that 
      transduces angular head velocity and provides this information to the brain via 
      motion-modulated electrical stimulation of canal afferent nerves could improve the 
      perception of angular head position relative to gravity in monkeys with severe 
      vestibular damage. Using a subjective visual vertical task, we found that normal 
      female monkeys accurately sensed the orientation of the head relative to gravity 
      during dynamic tilts, that this ability was degraded following bilateral vestibular 
      damage, and improved when the canal VI was used. These results demonstrate that a 
      canal VI can improve graviception in vestibulopathic animals, suggesting that it 
      could reduce the disabling perceptual and postural deficits experienced by patients 
      with severe vestibular damage.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Patients with vestibular damage 
      experience impaired vision, spatial perception, and balance, symptoms that could 
      potentially respond to a vestibular implant (VI). Anatomic features facilitate 
      semicircular canal (angular velocity) prosthetics but inhibit approaches with the 
      otolith (linear acceleration) organs, and canal VIs that sense angular head velocity 
      can generate compensatory eye velocity responses in vestibulopathic subjects. Can 
      the brain use canal VI head velocity information to improve estimates of head 
      orientation (e.g., head position relative to gravity), which is a prerequisite for 
      accurate spatial perception and posture? Here we show that a canal VI can improve 
      the perception of head orientation in vestibulopathic monkeys, results that are 
      highly significant because they suggest that VIs mimicking canal function can 
      improve spatial orientation and balance in vestibulopathic patients.

AB  - The integration of metabolic competence in developmental toxicity assays in vitro is 
      of fundamental importance to better predict adverse drug effects. Here, a 
      microfluidic hanging-drop platform is presented that seamlessly integrates liver 
      metabolism into the embryonic stem cell test (EST). Primary human liver microtissues 
      (hLiMTs) and embryoid bodies (EBs) are combined in the same fluidic network, so that 
      hLiMT-generated metabolites are directly transported to the EBs. Gravity-driven flow 
      through the network enables continuous intertissue communication, constant medium 
      turnover, and, most importantly, immediate exchange of metabolites. As a proof of 
      concept, the prodrug cyclophosphamide is investigated and a fourfold lower ID50 
      concentration (50% inhibition of EB differentiation) is found after 
      biotransformation, which demonstrates the potentially adverse effects of metabolites 
      on embryotoxicity. The metaEST platform provides a promising tool to increase the 
      predictive power of the current EST assay by more comprehensively including and 
      better reflecting physiological processes in in vitro tests.

AB  - Sediments in deep ocean trenches may contain crucial information on past earthquake 
      history and constitute important sites of carbon burial. Here we present (14)C data 
      on bulk organic carbon (OC) and its thermal decomposition fractions produced by 
      ramped pyrolysis/oxidation for a core retrieved from the >7.5 km-deep Japan Trench. 
      High-resolution (14)C measurements, coupled with distinctive thermogram 
      characteristics of OC, reveal hemipelagic sedimentation interrupted by episodic 
      deposition of pre-aged OC in the trench. Low δ(13)C values and diverse (14)C ages of 
      thermal fractions imply that the latter material originates from the adjacent 
      margin, and the co-occurrence of pre-aged OC with intervals corresponding to known 
      earthquake events implies tectonically triggered, gravity-flow-driven supply. We 
      show that (14)C ages of thermal fractions can yield valuable chronological 
      constraints on sedimentary sequences. Our findings shed new light on links between 
      tectonically driven sedimentological processes and marine carbon cycling, with 
      implications for carbon dynamics in hadal environments.

AB  - Information-driven engines that rectify thermal fluctuations are a modern 
      realization of the Maxwell-demon thought experiment. We introduce a simple design 
      based on a heavy colloidal particle, held by an optical trap and immersed in water. 
      Using a carefully designed feedback loop, our experimental realization of an 
      "information ratchet" takes advantage of favorable "up" fluctuations to lift a 
      weight against gravity, storing potential energy without doing external work. By 
      optimizing the ratchet design for performance via a simple theory, we find that the 
      rate of work storage and velocity of directed motion are limited only by the 
      physical parameters of the engine: the size of the particle, stiffness of the 
      ratchet spring, friction produced by the motion, and temperature of the surrounding 
      medium. Notably, because performance saturates with increasing frequency of 
      observations, the measurement process is not a limiting factor. The extracted power 
      and velocity are at least an order of magnitude higher than in previously reported 
      engines.

TI  - Fluorescein Aqueous Angiography in Live Normal Human Eyes.
PG  - 957-964
LID - 10.1097/IJG.0000000000001042 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate aqueous humor outflow (AHO) in intact eyes of live human 
      subjects during cataract surgery using fluorescein aqueous angiography. METHODS: 
      Aqueous angiography was performed in 8 live human subjects (56 to 86 y old; 2 men 
      and 6 women). After anesthesia, fluorescein (2%) was introduced into the eye [either 
      alone or after indocyanine green (ICG; 0.4%)] from a sterile, gravity-driven 
      constant-pressure reservoir. Aqueous angiographic images were obtained with a 
      Spectralis HRA+OCT and FLEX module (Heidelberg Engineering). Using the same device, 
      anterior-segment optical coherence tomography (OCT) and infrared images were also 
      concurrently taken with aqueous angiography. RESULTS: Fluorescein aqueous 
      angiography in the live human eye showed segmental AHO patterns. Initial 
      angiographic signal was seen on average by 14.0±3.0 seconds (mean±SE). Using 
      multimodal imaging, angiographically positive signal colocalized with episcleral 
      veins (infrared imaging) and intrascleral lumens (anterior-segment OCT). Sequential 
      aqueous angiography with ICG followed by fluorescein showed similar segmental 
      angiographic patterns. DISCUSSION: Fluorescein aqueous angiography in live humans 
      was similar to that reported in nonhuman primates and to ICG aqueous angiography in 
      live humans. As segmental patterns with sequential angiography using ICG followed by 
      fluorescein were similar, these tracers can now be used sequentially, before and 
      after trabecular outflow interventions, to assess their effects on AHO in live human 
      subjects.

AB  - Recent observations of Jupiter's Great Red Spot indicate that the thermosphere above 
      the storm is hotter than its surroundings by more than 700 K. Possible suggested 
      sources for this heating have thus far included atmospheric gravity waves and 
      lightning-driven acoustic waves. Here, we propose that Joule heating, driven by 
      Great Red Spot vorticity penetrating up into the lower stratosphere and coupling to 
      the thermosphere, may contribute to the large observed temperatures. The strength of 
      Joule heating will depend on the local inclination angle of the magnetic field and 
      thus the observed emissions and inferred temperatures should vary with planetary 
      longitude as the Great Red Spot tracks across the planet. This article is part of a 
      discussion meeting issue 'Advances in hydrogen molecular ions: H(3)(+), H(5)(+) and 
      beyond'.

LID - e0175753
AB  - Thin liquid films are central to everyday life. They are ubiquitous in modern 
      technology (pharmaceuticals, coatings), consumer products (foams, emulsions) and 
      also serve vital biological functions (tear film of the eye, pulmonary surfactants 
      in the lung). A common feature in all these examples is the presence of 
      surface-active molecules at the air-liquid interface. Though they form only 
      molecular-thin layers, these surfactants produce complex surface stresses on the 
      free surface, which have important consequences for the dynamics and stability of 
      the underlying thin liquid film. Here we conduct simple thinning experiments to 
      explore the fundamental mechanisms that allow the surfactant molecules to slow the 
      gravity-driven drainage of the underlying film. We present a simple model that works 
      for both soluble and insoluble surfactant systems in the limit of negligible 
      adsorption-desorption dynamics. We show that surfactants with finite surface 
      rheology influence bulk flow through viscoelastic interfacial stresses, while 
      surfactants with inviscid surfaces achieve stability through opposing 
      surface-tension induced Marangoni flows.

TI  - Floor- or Ceiling-Sliding for Chemically Active, Gyrotactic, Sedimenting Janus 
      Particles.
PG  - 7133-7147
LID - 10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b03696 [doi]
AB  - Chemically active particles achieve motility without external forces and torques 
      ("self-propulsion") due to catalytic chemical reactions at their surfaces, which 
      change the chemical composition of the surrounding solution (called "chemical 
      field") and induce hydrodynamic flow of the solution. By coupling the distortions of 
      these fields back to its motion, a chemically active particle experiences an 
      effective interaction with confining surfaces. This coupling can lead to a rich 
      behavior, such as the occurrence of wall-bound steady states of "sliding". Most 
      active particles are density mismatched with the solution and, thus, tend to 
      sediment. Moreover, the often employed Janus spheres, which consist of an inert core 
      material decorated with a cap-like, thin layer of a catalyst, are gyrotactic (i.e., 
      "bottom-heavy"). Whether or not they may exhibit sliding states at horizontal walls 
      depends on the interplay between the active motion and the gravity-driven 
      sedimentation and alignment, such as the gyrotactic tendency to align the axis along 
      the gravity direction being overcome by a competing, activity-driven alignment with 
      a different orientation. It is therefore important to understand and quantify the 
      influence of these gravity-induced effects on the behavior of model chemically 
      active particles moving in the vicinity of walls. For model gyrotactic, 
      self-phoretic Janus particles, here we study theoretically the occurrence of sliding 
      states at horizontal planar walls that are either below ("floor") or above 
      ("ceiling") the particle. We construct "state diagrams" characterizing the 
      occurrence of such states as a function of the sedimentation velocity and of the 
      gyrotactic response of the particle, as well as of the phoretic mobility of the 
      particle. We show that in certain cases sliding states may emerge simultaneously at 
      both the ceiling and the floor, while the larger part of the experimentally relevant 
      parameter space corresponds to particles that would exhibit sliding states only 
      either at the floor or at the ceiling-or there are no sliding states at all. These 
      predictions are critically compared with the results of previous experimental 
      studies, as well as with our dedicated experiments carried out with Pt-coated, 
      polystyrene-core, or silica-core Janus spheres immersed in aqueous hydrogen peroxide 
      solutions.

TI  - Transport and Burial of Microplastics in Deep-Marine Sediments by Turbidity 
      Currents.
PG  - 4180-4189
LID - 10.1021/acs.est.9b07527 [doi]
AB  - The threat posed by plastic pollution to marine ecosystems and human health is under 
      increasing scrutiny. Much of the macro- and microplastic in the ocean ends up on the 
      seafloor, with some of the highest concentrations reported in submarine canyons that 
      intersect the continental shelf and directly connect to terrestrial plastic sources. 
      Gravity-driven avalanches, known as turbidity currents, are the primary process for 
      delivering terrestrial sediment and organic carbon to the deep sea through submarine 
      canyons. However, the ability of turbidity currents to transport and bury plastics 
      is essentially unstudied. Using flume experiments, we investigate how turbidity 
      currents transport microplastics, and their role in differential burial of 
      microplastic fragments and fibers. We show that microplastic fragments become 
      relatively concentrated within the base of turbidity currents, whereas fibers are 
      more homogeneously distributed throughout the flow. Surprisingly, the resultant 
      deposits show an opposing trend, as they are enriched with fibers, rather than 
      fragments. We explain this apparent contradiction by a depositional mechanism 
      whereby fibers are preferentially removed from suspension and buried in the deposits 
      as they are trapped between settling sand-grains. Our results suggest that turbidity 
      currents potentially distribute and bury large quantities of microplastics in 
      seafloor sediments.

      anomaly.

LID - 10630
AB  - Granular flows occur widely in nature and industry, yet a continuum description that 
      captures their important features is yet not at hand. Recent experiments on granular 
      materials sheared in a cylindrical Couette device revealed a puzzling anomaly, 
      wherein all components of the stress rise nearly exponentially with depth. Here we 
      show, using particle dynamics simulations and imaging experiments, that the stress 
      anomaly arises from a remarkable vortex flow. For the entire range of fill heights 
      explored, we observe a single toroidal vortex that spans the entire Couette cell and 
      whose sense is opposite to the uppermost Taylor vortex in a fluid. We show that the 
      vortex is driven by a combination of shear-induced dilation, a phenomenon that has 
      no analogue in fluids, and gravity flow. Dilatancy is an important feature of 
      granular mechanics, but not adequately incorporated in existing models.

TI  - Could patient-controlled thirst-driven fluid administration lead to more rapid 
      rehydration than clinician-directed fluid management? An early feasibility study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fluid management is a major factor determining perioperative outcome, 
      yet in reality, fluid administration practice is variable. Thirst however, is a 
      highly sensitive and reliable indicator of fluid deficits. We explored the use of 
      thirst sensation to trigger i.v. fluid boluses to guide individualized fluid 
      management. METHODS: We performed a randomised double crossover trial on 16 healthy 
      male volunteers, of mean age 31 yr and BMI 24.4 kg m(-2). Twice, after 
      administrations of oral furosemide (40 mg) and 12 h of oral fluid restriction, 
      participants received a 4-h i.v. fluid infusion. In the experimental arm, 
      participants pressed a trigger to relieve their thirst, administering a 200 ml 
      bolus. In the control arm, i.v. fluid was infused following National Institute for 
      Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines at 1.25 ml kg(-1) h(-1) with a 
      clinician delivered 500 ml i.v. bolus in response to clinical signs of dehydration. 
      Plasma osmolality and urine specific gravity were measured before and after each 
      infusion. RESULTS: More fluid was infused in response to thirst than by adherence to 
      NICE guidelines, with a mean difference of 743 ml (P=0.0005). Thirst-driven fluid 
      administration was fitted to an exponential function of time, plateauing after a 
      mean half-life of 98.8 min. In the experimental arm there was a greater reduction in 
      urine specific gravity and thirst score with mean differences 0.0053 g cm(-3) 
      (P=0.002) and 3.3 (P=0.003), respectively. Plasma osmolality demonstrated no fluid 
      overload. CONCLUSIONS: A system delivering i.v. fluid in response to subjective 
      thirst corrects fluid deficits in healthy participants. A clinical feasibility study 
      will assess the potential use of this system in the perioperative setting. CLINICAL 
      TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT 03176043.

TI  - Assessment of Postnatal Pulmonary Adaption in Bovine Neonates Using Electric 
      Impedance Tomography (EIT).
LID - 10.3390/ani11113216 [doi]
LID - 3216
AB  - Several aspects of postnatal pulmonary adaption in the bovine neonate remain 
      unclear, particularly the dynamics and regional ventilation of the lungs. We used 
      electric impedance tomography (EIT) to measure changes in ventilation in the first 3 
      weeks of life in 20 non-sedated neonatal calves born without difficulty in sternal 
      recumbency. Arterial blood gas variables were determined in the first 24 h after 
      birth. Immediately after birth, dorsal parts of the lungs had 4.53% ± 2.82% 
      nondependent silent spaces (NSS), and ventral parts had 5.23% ± 2.66% dependent 
      silent spaces (DSS). The latter increased in the first hour, presumably because of 
      gravity-driven ventral movement of residual amniotic fluid. The remaining lung 
      regions had good ventilation immediately after birth, and the percentage of lung 
      regions with high ventilation increased significantly during the study period. The 
      centre of ventilation was always dorsal to and on the right of the theoretical 
      centre of ventilation. The right lung was responsible for a significantly larger 
      proportion of ventilation (63.84% ± 12.74%, p < 0.00001) compared with the left 
      lung. In the right lung, the centrodorsal lung area was the most ventilated, 
      whereas, in the left lung, it was the centroventral area. Tidal impedance changes, 
      serving as a surrogate for tidal volume, increased in the first 3 weeks of life (p < 
      0.00001). This study shows the dynamic changes in lung ventilation in the bovine 
      neonate according to EIT measurements. The findings form a basis for the recognition 
      of structural and functional lung disorders in neonatal calves.

AB  - Gravity- or buoyancy-driven bodies moving in a slightly viscous fluid frequently 
      follow fluttering or helical paths. Current models of such systems are largely 
      empirical and fail to predict several of the key features of their evolution, 
      especially close to the onset of path instability. Here, using a weakly nonlinear 
      expansion of the full set of governing equations, we present a new generic 
      reduced-order model based on a pair of amplitude equations with exact coefficients 
      that drive the evolution of the first pair of unstable modes. We show that the 
      predictions of this model for the style (e.g., fluttering or spiraling) and 
      characteristics (e.g., frequency and maximum inclination angle) of path oscillations 
      compare well with various recent data for both solid disks and air bubbles.

AB  - This communication presents analysis of gravity-driven flow of a thixotropic fluid 
      containing both nanoparticles and gyrotactic microorganisms along a vertical 
      surface. To further describe the transport phenomenon, special cases of active and 
      passive controls of nanoparticles are investigated. The governing partial 
      differential equations of momentum, energy, nanoparticles concentration, and density 
      of gyrotactic microorganisms equations are converted and parameterized into system 
      of ordinary differential equations and the series solutions are obtained through 
      Optimal Homotopy Analysis Method (OHAM). The related important parameters are tested 
      and shown on the velocity, temperature, concentration and density of motile 
      microorganisms profiles. It is observed that for both cases of active and passive 
      control of nanoparticles, incremental values of thermophoretic parameters 
      corresponds to decrease in the velocity distributions and augment the temperature 
      distributions.

AB  - Separation of water/alcohol miscible mixtures via direct filtration only under 
      gravity is a great challenge. Here, different alkyl chain grafted-reduced graphene 
      oxide (alkyl-RGO) is synthesized and characterized. The hydrophobic alkyl chains can 
      considerably modify the oil-wettability of the membranes and avoid water permeation. 
      The alkyl-RGO membrane obtained by vacuum filtration can separate water/oil 
      immiscible mixtures. Importantly, water/alcohol miscible mixtures could also be 
      separated solely under gravity, where alcohols efficiently permeate the alkyl-RGO 
      membrane while water is prevented through the membrane. The separation efficiency of 
      C(12)H-RGO membrane reaches up to about 0.04 vol% of water content for the case of 
      separating an n-propanol/water (90:10 v/v) mixture with high n-propanol permeability 
      of approx. 685 mL m(-2) h(-1). Molecular simulations indicate that the selective 
      absorption ability and diffusion rate also affect water/alcohol separation. The 
      alkyl-RGO membranes via gravity driven filtration can extend the applications of 
      separation of water/alcohol miscible mixtures.

TI  - Mechanobiological oscillators control lymph flow.
PG  - 10938-43
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1508330112 [doi]
AB  - The ability of cells to sense and respond to physical forces has been recognized for 
      decades, but researchers are only beginning to appreciate the fundamental importance 
      of mechanical signals in biology. At the larger scale, there has been increased 
      interest in the collective organization of cells and their ability to produce 
      complex, "emergent" behaviors. Often, these complex behaviors result in tissue-level 
      control mechanisms that manifest as biological oscillators, such as observed in 
      fireflies, heartbeats, and circadian rhythms. In many cases, these complex, 
      collective behaviors are controlled--at least in part--by physical forces imposed on 
      the tissue or created by the cells. Here, we use mathematical simulations to show 
      that two complementary mechanobiological oscillators are sufficient to control fluid 
      transport in the lymphatic system: Ca(2+)-mediated contractions can be triggered by 
      vessel stretch, whereas nitric oxide produced in response to the resulting fluid 
      shear stress causes the lymphatic vessel to relax locally. Our model predicts that 
      the Ca(2+) and NO levels alternate spatiotemporally, establishing complementary 
      feedback loops, and that the resulting phasic contractions drive lymph flow. We show 
      that this mechanism is self-regulating and robust over a range of fluid pressure 
      environments, allowing the lymphatic vessels to provide pumping when needed but 
      remain open when flow can be driven by tissue pressure or gravity. Our simulations 
      accurately reproduce the responses to pressure challenges and signaling pathway 
      manipulations observed experimentally, providing an integrated conceptual framework 
      for lymphatic function.

AB  - Motivated by the need for a better understanding of the transport of solutes in 
      microfluidic flows with free surfaces, the advection and dispersion of a passive 
      solute in steady unidirectional flow of a thin uniform rivulet on an inclined planar 
      substrate driven by gravity and/or a uniform longitudinal surface shear stress are 
      analysed. Firstly, we describe the short-time advection of both an initially 
      semi-infinite and an initially finite slug of solute of uniform concentration. 
      Secondly, we describe the long-time Taylor-Aris dispersion of an initially finite 
      slug of solute. In particular, we obtain the general expression for the effective 
      diffusivity for Taylor-Aris dispersion in such a rivulet, and discuss in detail its 
      different interpretations in the special case of a rivulet on a vertical substrate.

TI  - A globally fragmented and mobile lithosphere on Venus.
LID - 10.1073/pnas.2025919118 [doi]
LID - e2025919118
AB  - Venus has been thought to possess a globally continuous lithosphere, in contrast to 
      the mosaic of mobile tectonic plates that characterizes Earth. However, the Venus 
      surface has been extensively deformed, and convection of the underlying mantle, 
      possibly acting in concert with a low-strength lower crust, has been suggested as a 
      source of some surface horizontal strains. The extent of surface mobility on Venus 
      driven by mantle convection, however, and the style and scale of its tectonic 
      expression have been unclear. We report a globally distributed set of crustal blocks 
      in the Venus lowlands that show evidence for having rotated and/or moved laterally 
      relative to one another, akin to jostling pack ice. At least some of this 
      deformation on Venus postdates the emplacement of the locally youngest plains 
      materials. Lithospheric stresses calculated from interior viscous flow models 
      consistent with long-wavelength gravity and topography are sufficient to drive 
      brittle failure in the upper Venus crust in all areas where these blocks are 
      present, confirming that interior convective motion can provide a mechanism for 
      driving deformation at the surface. The limited but widespread lithospheric mobility 
      of Venus, in marked contrast to the tectonic styles indicative of a static 
      lithosphere on Mercury, the Moon, and Mars, may offer parallels to interior-surface 
      coupling on the early Earth, when global heat flux was substantially higher, and the 
      lithosphere generally thinner, than today.

LID - 55
AB  - BACKGROUND: Appropriate vertical movement is critical for the survival of flying 
      animals. Although negative geotaxis (moving away from Earth) driven by gravity has 
      been extensively studied, much less is understood concerning a static regulatory 
      mechanism for inducing positive geotaxis (moving toward Earth). RESULTS: Using 
      Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism, we showed that geomagnetic field (GMF) 
      induces positive geotaxis and antagonizes negative gravitaxis. Remarkably, GMF acts 
      as a sensory cue for an appetite-driven associative learning behavior through the 
      GMF-induced positive geotaxis. This GMF-induced positive geotaxis requires the three 
      geotaxis genes, such as cry, pyx and pdf, and the corresponding neurons residing in 
      Johnston's organ of the fly's antennae. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide a novel 
      concept with the neurogenetic basis on the regulation of vertical movement by GMF in 
      the flying animals.

TI  - Global upper-atmospheric heating on Jupiter by the polar aurorae.
PG  - 54-57
LID - 10.1038/s41586-021-03706-w [doi]
AB  - Jupiter's upper atmosphere is considerably hotter than expected from the amount of 
      sunlight that it receives(1-3). Processes that couple the magnetosphere to the 
      atmosphere give rise to intense auroral emissions and enormous deposition of energy 
      in the magnetic polar regions, so it has been presumed that redistribution of this 
      energy could heat the rest of the planet(4-6). Instead, most thermospheric global 
      circulation models demonstrate that auroral energy is trapped at high latitudes by 
      the strong winds on this rapidly rotating planet(3,5,7-10). Consequently, other 
      possible heat sources have continued to be studied, such as heating by gravity waves 
      and acoustic waves emanating from the lower atmosphere(2,11-13). Each mechanism 
      would imprint a unique signature on the global Jovian temperature gradients, thus 
      revealing the dominant heat source, but a lack of planet-wide, high-resolution data 
      has meant that these gradients have not been determined. Here we report infrared 
      spectroscopy of Jupiter with a spatial resolution of 2 degrees in longitude and 
      latitude, extending from pole to equator. We find that temperatures decrease 
      steadily from the auroral polar regions to the equator. Furthermore, during a period 
      of enhanced activity possibly driven by a solar wind compression, a high-temperature 
      planetary-scale structure was observed that may be propagating from the aurora. 
      These observations indicate that Jupiter's upper atmosphere is predominantly heated 
      by the redistribution of auroral energy.

LID - 10.1093/cercor/bhw133 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the contribution of stereopsis to the 
      processing of observed manipulative actions. To this end, we first combined the 
      factors "stimulus type" (action, static control, and dynamic control), "stereopsis" 
      (present, absent) and "viewpoint" (frontal, lateral) into a single design. Four 
      sites in premotor, retro-insular (2) and parietal cortex operated specifically when 
      actions were viewed stereoscopically and frontally. A second experiment clarified 
      that the stereo-action-specific regions were driven by actions moving out of the 
      frontoparallel plane, an effect amplified by frontal viewing in premotor cortex. 
      Analysis of single voxels and their discriminatory power showed that the 
      representation of action in the stereo-action-specific areas was more accurate when 
      stereopsis was active. Further analyses showed that the 4 stereo-action-specific 
      sites form a closed network converging onto the premotor node, which connects to 
      parietal and occipitotemporal regions outside the network. Several of the specific 
      sites are known to process vestibular signals, suggesting that the network combines 
      observed actions in peripersonal space with gravitational signals. These findings 
      have wider implications for the function of premotor cortex and the role of 
      stereopsis in human behavior.

PG  - 9029-35
LID - 10.1021/ac501491t [doi]
AB  - Point-of-care detection of pathogens is medically valuable but poses challenging 
      trade-offs between instrument complexity and clinical and analytical sensitivity. 
      Here we introduce a diagnostic platform utilizing lithographically fabricated 
      micron-scale forms of cubic retroreflectors, arguably one of the most optically 
      detectable human artifacts, as reporter labels for use in sensitive immunoassays. We 
      demonstrate the applicability of this novel optical label in a simple assay format 
      in which retroreflector cubes are first mixed with the sample. The cubes are then 
      allowed to settle onto an immuno-capture surface, followed by inversion for 
      gravity-driven removal of nonspecifically bound cubes. Cubes bridged to the capture 
      surface by the analyte are detected using inexpensive, low-numerical aperture 
      optics. For model bacterial and viral pathogens, sensitivity in 10% human serum was 
      found to be 10(4) bacterial cells/mL and 10(4) virus particles/mL, consistent with 
      clinical utility.

TI  - Energy Efficient Ultrahigh Flux Separation of Oily Pollutants from Water with 
      Superhydrophilic Nanoscale Metal-Organic Framework Architectures.
PG  - 5519-5526
LID - 10.1002/anie.202012428 [doi]
AB  - The rising demand for clean water for a growing and increasingly urban global 
      population is one of the most urgent issues of our time. Here, we introduce the 
      synthesis of a unique nanoscale architecture of pillar-like Co-CAT-1 metal-organic 
      framework (MOF) crystallites on gold-coated woven stainless steel meshes with large, 
      50 μm apertures. These nanostructured mesh surfaces feature superhydrophilic and 
      underwater superoleophobic wetting properties, allowing for gravity-driven, highly 
      efficient oil-water separation featuring water fluxes of up to nearly one million 
      L m(-2)  h(-1) . Water physisorption experiments reveal the hydrophilic nature of 
      Co-CAT-1 with a total water vapor uptake at room temperature of 470 cm(3)  g(-1) . 
      Semiempirical molecular orbital calculations shed light on water affinity of the 
      inner and outer pore surfaces. The MOF-based membranes enable high separation 
      efficiencies for a number of liquids tested, including the notorious water 
      pollutant, crude oil, affording chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentrations below 
      25 mg L(-1) of the effluent. Our results demonstrate the great impact of suitable 
      nanoscale surface architectures as a means of encoding on-surface extreme wetting 
      properties, yielding energy-efficient water-selective large-aperture membranes.

TI  - Bipolar mood cycles and lunar tidal cycles.
PG  - 923-931
LID - 10.1038/mp.2016.263 [doi]
AB  - In 17 patients with rapid cycling bipolar disorder, time-series analyses detected 
      synchronies between mood cycles and three lunar cycles that modulate the amplitude 
      of the moon's semi-diurnal gravimetric tides: the 14.8-day spring-neap cycle, the 
      13.7-day declination cycle and the 206-day cycle of perigee-syzygies ('supermoons'). 
      The analyses also revealed shifts among 1:2, 1:3, 2:3 and other modes of coupling of 
      mood cycles to the two bi-weekly lunar cycles. These shifts appear to be responses 
      to the conflicting demands of the mood cycles' being entrained simultaneously to two 
      different bi-weekly lunar cycles with slightly different periods. Measurements of 
      circadian rhythms in body temperature suggest a biological mechanism through which 
      transits of one of the moon's semi-diurnal gravimetric tides might have driven the 
      patients' bipolar cycles, by periodically entraining the circadian pacemaker to its 
      24.84-h rhythm and altering the pacemaker's phase-relationship to sleep in a manner 
      that is known to cause switches from depression to mania.

AB  - Natural CO2 releases from shallow marine hydrothermal vents are assumed to mix into 
      the water column, and not accumulate into stratified seafloor pools. We present 
      newly discovered shallow subsea pools located within the Santorini volcanic caldera 
      of the Southern Aegean Sea, Greece, that accumulate CO2 emissions from geologic 
      reservoirs. This type of hydrothermal seafloor pool, containing highly concentrated 
      CO2, provides direct evidence of shallow benthic CO2 accumulations originating from 
      sub-seafloor releases. Samples taken from within these acidic pools are devoid of 
      calcifying organisms, and channel structures among the pools indicate gravity driven 
      flow, suggesting that seafloor release of CO2 at this site may preferentially impact 
      benthic ecosystems. These naturally occurring seafloor pools may provide a 
      diagnostic indicator of incipient volcanic activity and can serve as an analog for 
      studying CO2 leakage and benthic accumulations from subsea carbon capture and 
      storage sites.

TI  - Surface textures suppress viscoelastic braking on soft substrates.
PG  - 32285-32292
LID - 10.1073/pnas.2008683117 [doi]
AB  - A gravity-driven droplet will rapidly flow down an inclined substrate, resisted only 
      by stresses inside the liquid. If the substrate is compliant, with an elastic 
      modulus G < 100 kPa, the droplet will markedly slow as a consequence of viscoelastic 
      braking. This phenomenon arises due to deformations of the solid at the moving 
      contact line, enhancing dissipation in the solid phase. Here, we pattern compliant 
      surfaces with textures and probe their interaction with droplets. We show that the 
      superhydrophobic Cassie state, where a droplet is supported atop air-immersed 
      textures, is preserved on soft textured substrates. Confocal microscopy reveals that 
      every texture in contact with the liquid is deformed by capillary stresses. This 
      deformation is coupled to liquid pinning induced by the orientation of contact lines 
      atop soft textures. Thus, compared to flat substrates, greater forcing is required 
      for the onset of drop motion when the soft solid is textured. Surprisingly, droplet 
      velocities down inclined soft or hard textured substrates are indistinguishable; the 
      textures thus suppress viscoelastic braking despite substantial fluid-solid contact. 
      High-speed microscopy shows that contact line velocities atop the pillars vastly 
      exceed those associated with viscoelastic braking. This velocity regime involves 
      less deformation, thus less dissipation, in the solid phase. Such rapid motions are 
      only possible because the textures introduce a new scale and contact-line geometry. 
      The contact-line orientation atop soft pillars induces significant deflections of 
      the pillars on the receding edge of the droplet; calculations confirm that this does 
      not slow down the droplet.

TI  - Detergent and Water Recovery from Laundry Wastewater Using Tilted Panel Membrane 
      Filtration System.
LID - 10.3390/membranes10100260 [doi]
LID - 260
AB  - Increasing global concern on clean water scarcity and environmental sustainability 
      drive invention in water reclamation technology. Laundry wastewater reclamation via 
      membrane technology faces the challenge of membrane fouling. This paper assesses a 
      tilting-the-filtration-panel filtration system for the treatment of real laundry 
      wastewater filtration aimed for water and detergent reuse. Results showed that the 
      panel tilting significantly improved fouling control and enhanced permeability due 
      to enhanced contact of air bubbles with the membrane surface, which induced 
      continuous detachment of foulant from the membrane surface. The combination of 
      aeration rate and tilting angle resulted in up to 83% permeability enhancement from 
      109 to 221.4 ± 10.8 (L/m(2)·h·bar). The system also offers 32% detergent recovery. 
      Overall findings suggest that the system offers an attractive approach for both 
      fouling management and detergent recovery and can potentially be applied under a 
      simple setup in which filtration can be driven by gravity/hydrostatic pressure.

LID - 20180206
AB  - The fundamental mechanisms governing macroscopic freckle defect formation during 
      directional solidification are studied experimentally in a Hele-Shaw cell for a 
      low-melting point Ga-25 wt.% In alloy and modelled numerically in three dimensions 
      using a microscopic parallelized Cellular Automata Lattice Boltzmann Method. The 
      size and distribution of freckles (long solute channels, or chimneys) are shown to 
      be strongly dependent on the thermal profile of the casting, with flat, concave and 
      convex isotherms being considered. For the flat isotherm case, no large-scale 
      freckles form, while for concave or convex isotherms, large freckles appear but in 
      different locations. The freckle formation mechanism is as expected buoyancy-driven, 
      but the chimney stability, its long-term endurance and its location are shown to 
      depend critically on the detailed convective transport through the inter-dendritic 
      region. Flow is generated by curved isopleths of solute concentration. As solute 
      density is different from that of the bulk fluid, gravity causes 'uphill' or 
      'downhill' lateral flow from the sample centre to the edges through the mush, 
      feeding the freckle. An excellent agreement is obtained between the numerical model 
      and real-time X-ray observations of a solidifying sample under strictly controlled 
      temperature conditions. This article is part of the theme issue 'Heterogeneous 
      materials: metastable and non-ergodic internal structures'.

TI  - On the compressional rheology of fresh faeces: Evidence for improving community 
      scale sanitation through localised dewatering.

LID - 10.1016/j.watres.2021.117526 [doi]
AB  - Non-sewered sanitation is currently dependant upon pit latrine emptying, the safety 
      of which is compromised by the high costs of faecal sludge transport to centralised 
      treatment facilities. Transport in turn is hindered by the complex rheology of pit 
      latrine sludge. This study therefore characterised the compressional rheology of 
      fresh faeces and modelled the implications for passive (gravity) or mechanical 
      (forced) solid/liquid separation. This informs on the viability of decentralising 
      dewatering for more efficient volume reduction and improving the economics of 
      transportation. The gel point (ϕ(g)) is the solids concentration where the material 
      has a networked structure and signifies the point when mechanical intervention is 
      required for further solid-liquid separation. For fresh faeces, ϕ(g) ranged between 
      6.3 and 15.6% total solids (TS) concentration. This is significantly higher than the 
      ϕ(g) observed for wastewater sludge at centralised facilities, and it implies that 
      passive gravity driven processes can suffice to improve localised dewatering. The 
      kinetics of passive sedimentation of faecal material were modelled and illustrate 
      thickening from 3 to 10% TS concentration in <0.5 h. This highlights that early 
      intervention to thicken faeces while fresh can improve solid/liquid separation 
      efficiency. Filtration of fresh faeces was characterised by lengthy cake filtration 
      times and comparably short compression times, more similar to mineral slurries than 
      to wastewater sludge. Consequently, fresh faeces presented improved dewatering 
      characteristics, supporting higher final cake solids concentrations and improved 
      dewatering kinetics. By complementing thickening with 300 kPa filtration, a 1.4 cm 
      thick 25% TS product could be achieved in <24 h. Investigation of matrix properties 
      highlighted that increased conductivity (e.g. exposure to urine) negatively 
      influenced dewaterability, an effect which could be mitigated by introducing 
      solid-liquid separation earlier. The thermodynamically favourable compressional 
      rheology of fresh faeces has identified that focussing on localised dewatering could 
      radically improve the economics of faecal sludge management, primarily through 
      reducing transport costs.

AB  - Microphysiological systems have potential as test systems in studying the intestinal 
      barrier, in which shear stress is critical for the differentiation of Caco-2 cells 
      into enterocytes. The most commonly used in vitro gut model for intestinal barrier 
      studies is based on trans-well cultures. Albeit useful, these culture systems lack 
      physiological shear stress which is believed to be critical for the differentiation 
      of Caco-2 cells into enterocytes and to form tight monolayers. Conversely, 
      organ-on-chip models have presented themselves as a promising alternative since it 
      provides cells with the required shear stress. To this end, a novel biocompatible 
      3D-printed microfluidic device was developed. In this device, Caco-2 cells were 
      seeded under physiologically-relevant unidirectional shear stress and compared to 
      cells cultured under gravity-driven flow. Using numerical studies, the flow rate 
      that corresponds to the required shear stress was calculated. Experimental tests 
      were conducted to verify the effect of this on cell differentiation. The experiments 
      clearly showed an enhancement of cell differentiation potential in a unidirectional 
      physiologically-relevant pump-driven flow system (PDFS) as opposed to the simpler 
      bidirectional gravity-driven flow system (GDFS). Additionally, computational 
      modeling of an adapted design confirmed its ability to supply all cells with a more 
      homogeneous shear stress, potentially further enhancing their differentiation. The 
      shear stress in the adapted design can be well-approximated with analytic methods, 
      thus allowing for efficient predictions for all parameter values in the system. The 
      developed novel microfluidic device led to the formation of a tighter monolayer and 
      enhanced functional properties of the differentiated Caco-2 cells, which presents a 
      promising tool for preclinical in vitro testing of drugs in an animal-free platform.

TI  - Priming of microcystin degradation in carbon-amended membrane biofilm communities is 
      promoted by oxygen-limited conditions.
LID - 10.1093/femsec/fiz157 [doi]
LID - fiz157
AB  - Microbial biofilms are an important element of gravity-driven membrane (GDM) 
      filtration systems for decentralized drinking water production. Mature biofilms fed 
      with biomass from the toxic cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa efficiently remove 
      the cyanotoxin microcystin (MC). MC degradation can be 'primed' by prior addition of 
      biomass from a non-toxic M. aeruginosa strain. Increased proportions of bacteria 
      with an anaerobic metabolism in M. aeruginosa-fed biofilms suggest that this 
      'priming' could be due to higher productivity and the resulting changes in habitat 
      conditions. We, therefore, investigated GDM systems amended with the biomass of 
      toxic (WT) or non-toxic (MUT) M. aeruginosa strains, of diatoms (DT), or with starch 
      solution (ST). After 25 days, these treatments were changed to receiving toxic 
      cyanobacterial biomass. MC degradation established significantly more rapidly in MUT 
      and ST than in DT. Oxygen measurements suggested that this was due to oxygen-limited 
      conditions in MUT and ST already prevailing before addition of MC-containing 
      biomass. Moreover, the microbial communities in the initial ST biofilms featured 
      high proportions of facultative anaerobic taxa, whereas aerobes dominated in DT 
      biofilms. Thus, the 'priming' of MC degradation in mature GDM biofilms seems to be 
      related to the prior establishment of oxygen-limited conditions mediated by higher 
      productivity.

AB  - Electroencephalography (EEG) alpha asymmetry is thought to reflect crucial brain 
      processes underlying executive control, motivation, and affect. It has been widely 
      used in psychopathology and, more recently, in novel neuromodulation studies. 
      However, inconsistencies remain in the field due to the lack of consensus in 
      methodological approaches employed and the recurrent use of small samples. Wearable 
      technologies ease the collection of large and diversified EEG datasets that better 
      reflect the general population, allow longitudinal monitoring of individuals, and 
      facilitate real-world experience sampling. We tested the feasibility of using a 
      low-cost wearable headset to collect a relatively large EEG database (N = 230, 22-80 
      years old, 64.3% female), and an open-source automatic method to preprocess it. We 
      then examined associations between well-being levels and the alpha center of gravity 
      (CoG) as well as trait EEG asymmetries, in the frontal and temporoparietal (TP) 
      areas. Robust linear regression models did not reveal an association between 
      well-being and alpha (8-13 Hz) asymmetry in the frontal regions, nor with the CoG. 
      However, well-being was associated with alpha asymmetry in the TP areas (i.e., 
      corresponding to relatively less left than right TP cortical activity as well-being 
      levels increased). This effect was driven by oscillatory activity in lower alpha 
      frequencies (8-10.5 Hz), reinforcing the importance of dissociating sub-components 
      of the alpha band when investigating alpha asymmetries. Age was correlated with both 
      well-being and alpha asymmetry scores, but gender was not. Finally, EEG asymmetries 
      in the other frequency bands were not associated with well-being, supporting the 
      specific role of alpha asymmetries with the brain mechanisms underlying well-being 
      levels. Interpretations, limitations, and recommendations for future studies are 
      discussed. This paper presents novel methodological, experimental, and theoretical 
      findings that help advance human neurophysiological monitoring techniques using 
      wearable neurotechnologies and increase the feasibility of their implementation into 
      real-world applications.

AB  - Access to safe drinking water is still a distant dream to millions of people around 
      the world. Especially, people from the low-income group in the developing countries 
      remain deprived of this fundamental right and causes millions of death. There is an 
      urgent need to develop affordable and easy to handle water filter which can provide 
      desired drinking water quality without any electricity. In the present work, a 
      simple and low-cost surface engineered particle (SEP) based filter is developed via 
      alkali treatment of soda-lime-silica particle. The SEP based filter can be used as a 
      portable, non-electric, gravity-driven Point-of-Use (POU) water disinfection system. 
      The developed SEP-based filter is capable to arrest the 99.48% (~2 to 2.5 log(10) 
      reduction) of gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli (E. coli OP50) on its surface 
      from the water containing 3 × 10(8) cells/ml. No bacterial regrowth is observed in 
      the purified water for 12 h. The performance of SEP bed filter is implicated to the 
      nano-scale surface roughness, its distribution along with the surface charge and 
      surface hydrophobicity which are favorable to attract and adhere the bacteria in the 
      flowing water. The observation is consistent over multiple filtration cycles 
      indicating the suitability of SEP based bed filter for POU water disinfection. The 
      SEP surface with 0.05 mM Ag(+) loading (SEP(+)) completely inactivated (>99.99999%) 
      bacteria and protects any bacteria recontamination in the purified water for its 
      long term usage. The strong and effective silver binding property of SEP surface 
      enables very minimal silver loading and eliminates any health hazard due to low 
      silver leaching (~50 ppb) which is well below the drinking water equivalent level 
      (DWEL ≤ 100 ppb). In rural and urban slum areas of developing countries where no 
      water purification system exists prior to consumption, the easy-to-implement and 
      affordable SEP-based gravity-driven non-electric point-of-use water purifier 
      (materials cost ~ 0.25 USD) can be used to protect millions of lives from water 
      borne diseases.

AB  - Post-eruptive destabilization of volcanic edifices by gravity driven debris flows or 
      erosion can catastrophically impact the landscapes, economies and human societies 
      surrounding active volcanoes. In this work, we propose cosmic-ray muon imaging 
      (muography) as a tool for the remote monitoring of hydrogeomorphic responses to 
      volcano landscape disturbances. We conducted the muographic monitoring of Sakurajima 
      volcano, Kyushu, Japan and measured continuous post-eruptive activity with over 30 
      lahars per year. The sensitive surface area of the 
      Multi-Wire-Proportional-Chamber-based Muography Observation System was upgraded to 
      7.67 m[Formula: see text]; this made it possible for the density of tephra within 
      the crater region to be measured in 40 days. We observed the muon flux decrease from 
      10 to 40% through the different regions of the crater from September 2019 to October 
      2020 due to the continuous deposition of tephra fallouts. In spite of the long-term 
      mass increase, significant mass decreases were also observed after the onsets of 
      rain-triggered lahars that induced the erosion of sedimented tephra. The first 
      muographic observation of these post-eruptive phenomena demonstrate that this 
      passive imaging technique has the potential to contribute to the assessment of 
      indirect volcanic hazards.

TI  - Biology of the sauropod dinosaurs: the evolution of gigantism.
PG  - 117-55
LID - 10.1111/j.1469-185X.2010.00137.x [doi]
AB  - The herbivorous sauropod dinosaurs of the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods were the 
      largest terrestrial animals ever, surpassing the largest herbivorous mammals by an 
      order of magnitude in body mass. Several evolutionary lineages among Sauropoda 
      produced giants with body masses in excess of 50 metric tonnes by conservative 
      estimates. With body mass increase driven by the selective advantages of large body 
      size, animal lineages will increase in body size until they reach the limit 
      determined by the interplay of bauplan, biology, and resource availability. There is 
      no evidence, however, that resource availability and global physicochemical 
      parameters were different enough in the Mesozoic to have led to sauropod gigantism. 
      We review the biology of sauropod dinosaurs in detail and posit that sauropod 
      gigantism was made possible by a specific combination of plesiomorphic characters 
      (phylogenetic heritage) and evolutionary innovations at different levels which 
      triggered a remarkable evolutionary cascade. Of these key innovations, the most 
      important probably was the very long neck, the most conspicuous feature of the 
      sauropod bauplan. Compared to other herbivores, the long neck allowed more efficient 
      food uptake than in other large herbivores by covering a much larger feeding 
      envelope and making food accessible that was out of the reach of other herbivores. 
      Sauropods thus must have been able to take up more energy from their environment 
      than other herbivores. The long neck, in turn, could only evolve because of the 
      small head and the extensive pneumatization of the sauropod axial skeleton, 
      lightening the neck. The small head was possible because food was ingested without 
      mastication. Both mastication and a gastric mill would have limited food uptake 
      rate. Scaling relationships between gastrointestinal tract size and basal metabolic 
      rate (BMR) suggest that sauropods compensated for the lack of particle reduction 
      with long retention times, even at high uptake rates. The extensive pneumatization 
      of the axial skeleton resulted from the evolution of an avian-style respiratory 
      system, presumably at the base of Saurischia. An avian-style respiratory system 
      would also have lowered the cost of breathing, reduced specific gravity, and may 
      have been important in removing excess body heat. Another crucial innovation 
      inherited from basal dinosaurs was a high BMR. This is required for fueling the high 
      growth rate necessary for a multi-tonne animal to survive to reproductive maturity. 
      The retention of the plesiomorphic oviparous mode of reproduction appears to have 
      been critical as well, allowing much faster population recovery than in 
      megaherbivore mammals. Sauropods produced numerous but small offspring each season 
      while land mammals show a negative correlation of reproductive output to body size. 
      This permitted lower population densities in sauropods than in megaherbivore mammals 
      but larger individuals. Our work on sauropod dinosaurs thus informs us about 
      evolutionary limits to body size in other groups of herbivorous terrestrial 
      tetrapods. Ectothermic reptiles are strongly limited by their low BMR, remaining 
      small. Mammals are limited by their extensive mastication and their vivipary, while 
      ornithsichian dinosaurs were only limited by their extensive mastication, having 
      greater average body sizes than mammals.

AB  - Inspired by the multifunctionality of biological surfaces necessary for the survival 
      of an organism in its specific environment, we developed an artificial special 
      wetting nanofur surface which can be adapted to perform different functionalities 
      necessary to efficiently separate oil and water for cleaning accidental oil spills 
      or separating industrial oily wastewater. Initial superhydrophobic nanofur surface 
      is fabricated using a hot pulling method, in which nano- and microhairs are drawn 
      out of the polymer surface during separation from a heated sandblasted steel plate. 
      By using a set of simple modification techniques, which include microperforation, 
      plasma treatment and subsequent control of storage environment, we achieved 
      selective separation of either water or oil, variable oil absorption and continuous 
      gravity driven separation of oil/water mixtures by filtration. Furthermore, these 
      functions can be performed using special wetting nanofur made from various 
      thermoplastics, including biodegradable and recyclable polymers. Additionally, 
      nanofur can be reused after washing it with organic solvents, thus, further helping 
      to reduce the environmental impacts of oil/water separation processes.

AB  - Our world is increasingly powered by electricity, which is largely converted to or 
      from mechanical energy using electric motors. Several applications have driven the 
      miniaturization of these machines, resulting in high rotational speeds. Although 
      speeds of several hundred thousand revolutions per minute have been used 
      industrially, we report the realization of an electrical motor reaching 40 million 
      rpm to explore the underlying physical boundaries. Millimeter-scale steel spheres, 
      which are levitated and accelerated by magnetic fields inside a vacuum, are used as 
      a rotor. Circumferential speeds exceeding 1000 m/s and centrifugal accelerations of 
      more than 4 × 10(8) times gravity were reached. The results open up new research 
      possibilities, such as the testing of materials under extreme centrifugal load, and 
      provide insights into the development of future electric drive systems.

AB  - The use of microwells is popular for a wide range of applications due to its' 
      simplicity. However, the seeding of conventional microwells, which are closed at the 
      bottom, is restricted to gravitational sedimentation for cell or particle deposition 
      and therefore require lengthy settling times to maximize well occupancy. The 
      addition of microfluidics to the capture process has accelerated cell or particle 
      dispersion and improved capture ability but is mostly limited to 
      gravitationally-driven settling for capture into the wells. An alternative approach 
      to conventional closed-microwells, sieved microwells supersedes reliance on gravity 
      by using hydrodynamic forces through the open pores at the bottom of the microwells 
      to draw targets into the wells. We have developed a rapid fabrication method, based 
      on flow lithography techniques, which allows us to easily customize the mesh pore 
      sizes in a simple two-step process. Finally, by combining this microwell design with 
      cross-flow trapping in a microfluidic two-layered channel, we achieve an 88 ± 6% 
      well occupancy in under 10 s.

TI  - Biomimetic robotics should be based on functional morphology.
PG  - 331-42
AB  - Due to technological improvements made during the last decade, bipedal robots today 
      present a surprisingly high level of humanoid skill. Autonomy, with respect to the 
      processing of information, is realized to a relatively high degree. What is mainly 
      lacking in robotics, moving from purely anthropomorphic robots to 
      'anthropofunctional' machines, is energetic autonomy. In a previously published 
      analysis, we showed that closer attention to the functional morphology of human 
      walking could give robotic engineers the experiences of an at least 6 Myr beta test 
      period on minimization of power requirements for biped locomotion. From our point of 
      view, there are two main features that facilitate sustained walking in modern 
      humans. The first main feature is the existence of 'energetically optimal 
      velocities' provided by the systematic use of various resonance mechanisms: (a). 
      suspended pendula (involving arms as well as legs in the swing phase of the gait 
      cycle) and matching of the pendular length of the upper and lower limbs; (b). 
      inverted pendula (involving the legs in the stance phase), driven by torsional 
      springs around the ankle joints; and (c). torsional springs in the trunk. The second 
      main feature is compensation for undesirable torques induced by the inertial 
      properties of the swinging extremities: (a). mass distribution in the trunk 
      characterized by maximized mass moments of inertia; (b). lever arms of joint forces 
      at the hip and shoulder, which are inversely proportional to their amplitude; and 
      (c). twisting of the trunk, especially torsion. Our qualitative conclusions are 
      three-fold. (1). Human walking is an interplay between masses, gravity and 
      elasticity, which is modulated by musculature. Rigid body mechanics is insufficient 
      to describe human walking. Thus anthropomorphic robots completely following the 
      rules of rigid body mechanics cannot be functionally humanoid. (2). Humans are 
      vertebrates. Thus, anthropomorphic robots that do not use the trunk for purposes of 
      motion are not truly humanoid. (3). The occurrence of a waist, especially 
      characteristic of humans, implies the existence of rotations between the upper trunk 
      (head, neck, pectoral girdle and thorax) and the lower trunk (pelvic girdle) via an 
      elastic joint (spine, paravertebral and abdominal musculature). A torsional twist 
      around longitudinal axes seems to be the most important.

AB  - Bacteria occupy heterogeneous environments, attaching and growing within pores in 
      materials, living hosts, and matrices like soil. Systems that permit high-resolution 
      visualization of dynamic bacterial processes within the physical confines of a 
      realistic and tractable porous media environment are rare. Here we use microfluidics 
      to replicate the grain shape and packing density of natural sands in a 2D platform 
      to study the flow-induced spatial evolution of bacterial biofilms underground. We 
      discover that initial bacterial dispersal and grain attachment is influenced by 
      bacterial transport across pore space velocity gradients, a phenomenon otherwise 
      known as rheotaxis. We find that gravity-driven flow conditions activate different 
      bacterial cell-clustering phenotypes depending on the strain's ability to product 
      extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). A wildtype, biofilm-producing bacteria 
      formed compact, multicellular patches while an EPS-defective mutant displayed a 
      linked-cell phenotype in the presence of flow. These phenotypes subsequently 
      influenced the overall spatial distribution of cells across the porous media network 
      as colonies grew and altered the fluid dynamics of their microenvironment.

TI  - How trade affects pandemics? Evidence from severe acute respiratory syndromes in 
      2003.
LID - 10.1111/twec.13127 [doi]
AB  - This paper investigates whether the rapid expansion of international trade after 
      China's WTO entry in 2001 promotes the spread of severe acute respiratory syndromes 
      (SARS) in 2003. Examining the relationship is helpful to distinguish the hidden 
      costs of trade openness. This paper uses Frankel and Romer (1999, The American 
      Economic Review, 89, 379) framework to construct the geography-based instruments by 
      applying province-country gravity relation for causal identification. Utilising 
      cross-section data of SARS cases of 31 provinces in China, our two-stage least 
      squares regression results show that international trade accelerates the spread of 
      SARS. Cross-country evidence also suggests the causal relation. In addition, we find 
      that the people's inter-provincial mobility driven by trade expansion drives the 
      spread of epidemic diseases.

TI  - Model-Based Estimation of Ankle Joint Stiffness.
LID - 10.3390/s17040713 [doi]
LID - 713
AB  - We address the estimation of biomechanical parameters with wearable measurement 
      technologies. In particular, we focus on the estimation of sagittal plane ankle 
      joint stiffness in dorsiflexion/plantar flexion. For this estimation, a novel 
      nonlinear biomechanical model of the lower leg was formulated that is driven by 
      electromyographic signals. The model incorporates a two-dimensional kinematic 
      description in the sagittal plane for the calculation of muscle lever arms and 
      torques. To reduce estimation errors due to model uncertainties, a filtering 
      algorithm is necessary that employs segmental orientation sensor measurements. 
      Because of the model's inherent nonlinearities and nonsmooth dynamics, a square-root 
      cubature Kalman filter was developed. The performance of the novel estimation 
      approach was evaluated in silico and in an experimental procedure. The experimental 
      study was conducted with body-worn sensors and a test-bench that was specifically 
      designed to obtain reference angle and torque measurements for a single joint. 
      Results show that the filter is able to reconstruct joint angle positions, 
      velocities and torque, as well as, joint stiffness during experimental test bench 
      movements.

TI  - Closed-loop control of soft continuum manipulators under tip follower actuation.
PG  - 923-938
LID - 10.1177/0278364921997167 [doi]
AB  - Continuum manipulators, inspired by nature, have drawn significant interest within 
      the robotics community. They can facilitate motion within complex environments where 
      traditional rigid robots may be ineffective, while maintaining a reasonable degree 
      of precision. Soft continuum manipulators have emerged as a growing subfield of 
      continuum robotics, with promise for applications requiring high compliance, 
      including certain medical procedures. This has driven demand for new control schemes 
      designed to precisely control these highly flexible manipulators, whose kinematics 
      may be sensitive to external loads, such as gravity. This article presents one such 
      approach, utilizing a rapidly computed kinematic model based on Cosserat rod theory, 
      coupled with sensor feedback to facilitate closed-loop control, for a soft continuum 
      manipulator under tip follower actuation and external loading. This approach is 
      suited to soft manipulators undergoing quasi-static deployment, where actuators 
      apply a follower wrench (i.e., one that is in a constant body frame direction 
      regardless of robot configuration) anywhere along the continuum structure, as can be 
      done in water-jet propulsion. In this article we apply the framework specifically to 
      a tip actuated soft continuum manipulator. The proposed control scheme employs both 
      actuator feedback and pose feedback. The actuator feedback is utilized to both 
      regulate the follower load and to compensate for non-linearities of the actuation 
      system that can introduce kinematic model error. Pose feedback is required to 
      maintain accurate path following. Experimental results demonstrate successful path 
      following with the closed-loop control scheme, with significant performance 
      improvements gained through the use of sensor feedback when compared with the 
      open-loop case.

TI  - Closed-loop feedback control for microfluidic systems through automated capacitive 
      fluid height sensing.
PG  - 902-914
LID - 10.1039/c7lc01223c [doi]
AB  - Precise fluid height sensing in open-channel microfluidics has long been a desirable 
      feature for a wide range of applications. However, performing accurate measurements 
      of the fluid level in small-scale reservoirs (<1 mL) has proven to be an elusive 
      goal, especially if direct fluid-sensor contact needs to be avoided. In particular, 
      gravity-driven systems used in several microfluidic applications to establish 
      pressure gradients and impose flow remain open-loop and largely unmonitored due to 
      these sensing limitations. Here we present an optimized self-shielded coplanar 
      capacitive sensor design and automated control system to provide submillimeter 
      fluid-height resolution (∼250 μm) and control of small-scale open reservoirs without 
      the need for direct fluid contact. Results from testing and validation of our 
      optimized sensor and system also suggest that accurate fluid height information can 
      be used to robustly characterize, calibrate and dynamically control a range of 
      microfluidic systems with complex pumping mechanisms, even in cell culture 
      conditions. Capacitive sensing technology provides a scalable and cost-effective way 
      to enable continuous monitoring and closed-loop feedback control of fluid volumes in 
      small-scale gravity-dominated wells in a variety of microfluidic applications.

TI  - In-Situ Laser Polishing Additive Manufactured AlSi10Mg: Effect of Laser Polishing 
      Strategy on Surface Morphology, Roughness and Microhardness.
LID - 10.3390/ma14020393 [doi]
LID - 393
AB  - Laser polishing is a widely used technology to improve the surface quality of the 
      products. However, the investigation on the physical mechanism is still lacking. In 
      this paper, the established numerical transient model reveals the rough surface 
      evolution mechanism during laser polishing. Mass transfer driven by Marangoni force, 
      surface tension and gravity appears in the laser-induced molten pool so that the 
      polished surface topography tends to be smoother. The AlSi10Mg samples fabricated by 
      laser-based powder bed fusion were polished at different laser hatching spaces, 
      passes and directions to gain insight into the variation of the surface 
      morphologies, roughness and microhardness in this paper. The experimental results 
      show that after laser polishing, the surface roughness of Ra and Sa of the upper 
      surface can be reduced from 12.5 μm to 3.7 μm and from to 29.3 μm to 8.4 μm, 
      respectively, due to sufficient wetting in the molten pool. The microhardness of the 
      upper surface can be elevated from 112.3 HV to 176.9 HV under the combined influence 
      of the grain refinement, elements distribution change and surface defects 
      elimination. Better surface quality can be gained by decreasing the hatching space, 
      increasing polishing pass or choosing apposite laser direction.

TI  - Geological implication of grain-size segregation in dense granular matter.
LID - 10.1098/rsta.2017.0390 [doi]
LID - 20170390
AB  - To the current common belief, grain size segregation in granular matter requires 
      sufficient porosity. Therefore, grain size segregation found in a natural fault 
      gouge could imply elevated fluid pressure and the reduced normal stress on fault, 
      possibly caused by the frictional heat during an earthquake. To clarify whether 
      fluidization is essential to grain size segregation, we conduct numerical simulation 
      on a simple model of fault gouge in a plane shear geometry under constant volume 
      condition: the volume fraction is fixed at 0.6, at which the granular system 
      possesses yield stress. We observe apparent grain size segregation at this volume 
      fraction, meaning that grain size segregation alone does not imply fluidization of 
      granular matter. We also show that segregation is driven by the nonlinear velocity 
      profile, and that the gravity is not essential to segregation. The physical 
      condition tested here may be relevant to earthquake faults: the normal stress of 
      1 MPa, the sliding velocity of 1 m s(-1), and the duration of 0.1 s.This article is 
      part of the theme issue 'Statistical physics of fracture and earthquakes'.

TI  - Dual-Functional Porous Wood Filter for Simultaneous Oil/Water Separation and Organic 
      Pollutant Removal.
PG  - 14096-14103
LID - 10.1021/acsomega.0c01606 [doi]
AB  - High-performance functional materials capable of simultaneously separating oil from 
      water and removing water-soluble contaminants are critically demanded for wastewater 
      treatment but remain highly challenging. Wood, a naturally occurring porous material 
      composed of numerous open microchannels along the growth direction, may serve as a 
      desirable scaffold for the development of efficient filtration materials for water 
      treatment. Herein, by in situ deposition of silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) within the 
      channels of balsa wood, we developed dual-functional Ag/wood filters for 
      simultaneous oil/water separation and organic dye removal from water in a one-step 
      process. Owing to their superhydrophilicity and underwater superoleophobicity, the 
      as-prepared Ag/wood filters can selectively separate water from oil with a high 
      efficiency (∼99%). Moreover, benefiting from the catalytic activity of Ag NPs 
      anchored to the surface of the wood channels, the Ag/wood filters effectively 
      removed methylene blue (MB) from water during the oil/water separation process; the 
      MB removal efficiency was highly dependent on the thickness of the wood filters. 
      Specifically, the gravity-driven separation using a 6 mm-thick Ag/wood filter showed 
      a high MB degradation efficiency of 94.03% and a water flux of 2600 L·m(-2)·h(-1). 
      The proposed wood-based filtration material features renewable, inexpensive raw 
      materials, facile processing, and scale-up potential. Such dual-functional Ag/wood 
      filters capable of rapid and efficient removal of insoluble oils and soluble 
      pollutants from water in a one-step process offer a promising solution for 
      wastewater treatment.

      large-scale gravitational phenomena off the Crotone Basin, a forearc basin located 
      on the Ionian side of Calabria (southern Italy), by seismic, morpho-bathymetric and 
      well data. Our study reveals that the Crotone Megalandslide started moving between 
      Late Zanclean and Early Piacenzian and was triggered by a contractional tectonic 
      event leading to the basin inversion. Seaward gliding of the megalandslide continued 
      until roughly Late Gelasian, and then resumed since Middle Pleistocene with a modest 
      rate. Interestingly, the onshore part of the basin does not show a gravity-driven 
      deformation comparable to that observed in the marine area, and this peculiar 
      evidence allows some speculations on the origin of the megalandslide.

AB  - Cellular microenvironments are dynamic. When exposed to extracellular cues, such as 
      changing concentrations of inflammatory cytokines, cells activate signaling networks 
      that mediate fate decisions. Exploring responses broadly to time-varying 
      microenvironments is essential to understand the information transmission 
      capabilities of signaling networks and how dynamic milieus influence cell fate 
      decisions. Here, we present a gravity-driven cell culture and demonstrate that the 
      system accurately produces user-defined concentration profiles for one or more 
      dynamic stimuli. As proof of principle, we monitor nuclear factor-κB activation in 
      single cells exposed to dynamic cytokine stimulation and reveal context-dependent 
      sensitivity and uncharacterized single-cell response classes distinct from 
      persistent stimulation. Using computational modeling, we find that cell-to-cell 
      variability in feedback rates within the signaling network contributes to different 
      response classes. Models are validated using inhibitors to predictably modulate 
      response classes in live cells exposed to dynamic stimuli. These hidden 
      capabilities, uncovered through dynamic stimulation, provide opportunities to 
      discover and manipulate signaling mechanisms.

AB  - In vitro screening methods for compound efficacy and toxicity to date mostly include 
      cell or tissue exposure to preset constant compound concentrations over a defined 
      testing period. Such concentration profiles, however, do not represent realistic in 
      vivo situations after substance uptake. Absorption, distribution, metabolism and 
      excretion of administered substances in an organism or human body entail gradually 
      changing pharmacokinetic concentration profiles. As concentration profile dynamics 
      can influence drug effects on the target tissues, it is important to be able to 
      reproduce realistic concentration profiles in in vitro systems. We present a novel 
      design that can be integrated in tubing-free, microfluidic culture chips. These 
      chips are actuated by tilting so that gravity-driven flow and perfusion of culture 
      chambers can be established between reservoirs at both ends of a microfluidic 
      channel. The design enables the realization of in vivo-like substance exposure 
      scenarios. Compound gradients are generated through an asymmetric Y-junction of 
      channels with different hydrodynamic resistances. Six microtissues (MTs) can be 
      cultured and exposed in compartments along the channel. Changes of the chip design 
      or operation parameters enable to alter the dosing profile over a large range. 
      Modulation of, e.g., the tilting angle, changes the slope of the dosing curves, so 
      that concentration curves can be attained that resemble the pharmacokinetic 
      characteristics of common substances in a human body. Human colorectal cancer (HCT 
      116) MTs were exposed to both, gradually decreasing and constant concentrations of 
      Staurosporine. Measurements of apoptosis induction and viability after 5 h and 24 h 
      showed different short- and long-term responses of the MTs to dynamic and linear 
      dosing regimes.

TI  - Root hydrotropism is controlled via a cortex-specific growth mechanism.
PG  - 17057
LID - 10.1038/nplants.2017.57 [doi]
AB  - Plants can acclimate by using tropisms to link the direction of growth to 
      environmental conditions. Hydrotropism allows roots to forage for water, a process 
      known to depend on abscisic acid (ABA) but whose molecular and cellular basis 
      remains unclear. Here we show that hydrotropism still occurs in roots after laser 
      ablation removed the meristem and root cap. Additionally, targeted expression 
      studies reveal that hydrotropism depends on the ABA signalling kinase SnRK2.2 and 
      the hydrotropism-specific MIZ1, both acting specifically in elongation zone cortical 
      cells. Conversely, hydrotropism, but not gravitropism, is inhibited by preventing 
      differential cell-length increases in the cortex, but not in other cell types. We 
      conclude that root tropic responses to gravity and water are driven by distinct 
      tissue-based mechanisms. In addition, unlike its role in root gravitropism, the 
      elongation zone performs a dual function during a hydrotropic response, both sensing 
      a water potential gradient and subsequently undergoing differential growth.

      brightness variations.

AB  - A significant part of the intrinsic brightness variations in cool stars of low and 
      intermediate mass arises from surface convection (seen as granulation) and acoustic 
      oscillations (p-mode pulsations). The characteristics of these phenomena are largely 
      determined by the stars' surface gravity (g). Detailed photometric measurements of 
      either signal can yield an accurate value of g. However, even with ultraprecise 
      photometry from NASA's Kepler mission, many stars are too faint for current methods 
      or only moderate accuracy can be achieved in a limited range of stellar evolutionary 
      stages. This means that many of the stars in the Kepler sample, including exoplanet 
      hosts, are not sufficiently characterized to fully describe the sample and exoplanet 
      properties. We present a novel way to measure surface gravities with accuracies of 
      about 4%. Our technique exploits the tight relation between g and the characteristic 
      time scale of the combined granulation and p-mode oscillation signal. It is 
      applicable to all stars with a convective envelope, including active stars. It can 
      measure g in stars for which no other analysis is now possible. Because it depends 
      on the time scale (and no other properties) of the signal, our technique is largely 
      independent of the type of measurement (for example, photometry or radial velocity

      oscillation signal must be temporally resolved; thus, it cannot be applied to dwarf 
      stars observed by Kepler in its long-cadence mode.

TI  - Revealing the frictional transition in shear-thickening suspensions.
PG  - 5147-5152
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1703926114 [doi]
AB  - Shear thickening in dense particulate suspensions was recently proposed to be driven 
      by the activation of friction above an onset stress needed to overcome repulsive 
      forces between particles. Testing this scenario represents a major challenge because 
      classical rheological approaches do not provide access to the frictional properties 
      of suspensions. Here we adopt a different strategy inspired by pressure-imposed 
      configurations in granular flows that specifically gives access to this information. 
      By investigating the quasi-static avalanche angle, compaction, and dilatancy effects 
      in different nonbuoyant suspensions flowing under gravity, we demonstrate that 
      particles in shear-thickening suspensions are frictionless under low confining 
      pressure. Moreover, we show that tuning the range of the repulsive force below the 
      particle roughness suppresses the frictionless state and also the shear-thickening 
      behavior of the suspension. These results, which link microscopic contact physics to 
      the suspension macroscopic rheology, provide direct evidence that the recent 
      frictional transition scenario applies in real suspensions.

TI  - Spatial and temporal invasion dynamics of the 2014-2017 Zika and chikungunya 
      epidemics in Colombia.

LID - e1009174
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) were recently introduced into the 
      Americas resulting in significant disease burdens. Understanding their spatial and 
      temporal dynamics at the subnational level is key to informing surveillance and 
      preparedness for future epidemics. We analyzed anonymized line list data on 
      approximately 105,000 Zika virus disease and 412,000 chikungunya fever suspected and 
      laboratory-confirmed cases during the 2014-2017 epidemics. We first determined the 
      week of invasion in each city. Out of 1,122, 288 cities met criteria for epidemic 
      invasion by ZIKV and 338 cities by CHIKV. We analyzed risk factors for invasion 
      using linear and logistic regression models. We also estimated that the geographic 
      origin of both epidemics was located in Barranquilla, north Colombia. We assessed 
      the spatial and temporal invasion dynamics of both viruses to analyze transmission 
      between cities using a suite of (i) gravity models, (ii) Stouffer's rank models, and 
      (iii) radiation models with two types of distance metrics, geographic distance and 
      travel time between cities. Invasion risk was best captured by a gravity model when 
      accounting for geographic distance and intermediate levels of density dependence; 
      Stouffer's rank model with geographic distance performed similarly well. Although a 
      few long-distance invasion events occurred at the beginning of the epidemics, an 
      estimated distance power of 1.7 (95% CrI: 1.5-2.0) from the gravity models suggests 
      that spatial spread was primarily driven by short-distance transmission. 
      Similarities between the epidemics were highlighted by jointly fitted models, which 
      were preferred over individual models when the transmission intensity was allowed to 
      vary across arboviruses. However, ZIKV spread considerably faster than CHIKV.

AB  - High-resolution seismic reflection, magnetic and gravity data, acquired offshore of 
      Etna volcano, provide a new insight to understanding the relationship between 
      tectonics and spatial-temporal evolution of volcanism. The Timpe Plateau, a 
      structural high pertaining to the Hyblean foreland domain, located offshore of 
      southeastern Mt. Etna, is speckled by volcanics and strongly affected by strike-slip 
      tectonics. Transpressive deformation produced a push-up and a remarkable shortening 
      along WNW-ESE to NW-SE trending lineaments. Fault segments, bounding basinal areas, 
      show evidence of positive tectonic inversion, suggesting a former transtensive 
      phase. Transtensive tectonics favoured the emplacement of deep magmatic intrusive 
      bodies and Plio-Quaternary scattered volcanics through releasing zones. The 
      continuing of wrench tectonics along different shear zones led to the migration of 
      transtensive regions in the Etna area and the positive inversion of the former ones, 
      where new magma ascent was hampered. This process caused the shifting of volcanism 
      firstly along the main WNW-ESE trending "Southern Etna Shear Zone", then towards the 
      Valle del Bove and finally up to the present-day stratovolcano.

TI  - Hygro-responsive membranes for effective oil-water separation.
PG  - 1025
LID - 10.1038/ncomms2027 [doi]
AB  - There is a critical need for new energy-efficient solutions to separate oil-water 
      mixtures, especially those stabilized by surfactants. Traditional membrane-based 
      separation technologies are energy-intensive and limited, either by fouling or by 
      the inability of a single membrane to separate all types of oil-water mixtures. Here 
      we report membranes with hygro-responsive surfaces, which are both superhydrophilic 
      and superoleophobic, in air and under water. Our membranes can separate, for the 
      first time, a range of different oil-water mixtures in a single-unit operation, with 
      >99.9% separation efficiency, by using the difference in capillary forces acting on 
      the two phases. Our separation methodology is solely gravity-driven and consequently 
      is expected to be highly energy-efficient. We anticipate that our separation 
      methodology will have numerous applications, including the clean-up of oil spills, 
      wastewater treatment, fuel purification and the separation of commercially relevant 
      emulsions.

TI  - Stereopsis outweighs gravity in the control of the eyes.
PG  - RC126
AB  - The eyes are controlled by multiple brain circuits, some phylogenetically old and 
      some new, whose aims may conflict. Old otolith reflexes counterroll the eyes when 
      the head tilts relative to gravity. Newer vergence mechanisms coordinate the eyes to 
      aid stereoptic vision. We show that counterroll hinders stereopsis, weakly when you 
      look into the distance but strongly when you look near. The resolution of this 
      conflict is that counterroll virtually vanishes when monkeys look close, i.e., 
      stereopsis overrides gravity-driven reflexes but only on near gaze. This balance 
      between gyroscopic and stereoptic mechanisms explains many other puzzling features 
      of primate gaze control, such as the weakness of our otolith-ocular reflexes even 
      during far viewing and the strange geometry of the primate counterpitch reflex, 
      which rolls the eyes clockwise when monkeys look leftward while their heads are 
      tipped nose up, but rolls them counterclockwise when the monkeys look rightward, and 
      reverses this pattern when the head is tipped nose down.

TI  - Viewpoint and center of gravity affect eye movements to human faces.
PG  - 7.1-16
LID - 10.1167/9.2.7 [doi]
AB  - In everyday life, human faces are encountered in many different views. Despite this 
      fact, most psychological research has focused on the perception of frontal faces. To 
      address this shortcoming, the current study investigated how different face views 
      are processed, by measuring eye movements to frontal, mid-profile and profile faces 
      during a gender categorization (Experiment 1) and a free-viewing task (Experiment 
      2). In both experiments observers initially fixated the geometric center of a face, 
      independent of face view. This center-of-gravity effect induced a qualitative shift 
      in the features that were sampled across different face views in the time period 
      immediately after stimulus onset. Subsequent eye fixations focused increasingly on 
      specific facial features. At this stage, the eye regions were targeted predominantly 
      in all face views, and to a lesser extent also the nose and the mouth. These 
      findings show that initial saccades to faces are driven by general stimulus 
      properties, before eye movements are redirected to the specific facial features in 
      which observers take an interest. These findings are illustrated in detail by 
      plotting the distribution of fixations, first fixations, and percentage fixations 
      across time.

AB  - Open-surface microfluidics is promising in terms of enabling economical and rapid 
      biochemical analysis for addressing challenges associated with medical diagnosis and 
      food safety. To this end, we present a simple and economical approach to develop an 
      open-surface microfluidic platform suitable for facile liquid transport and mixing. 
      Customizable patterns with tailored wettability are deposited using a 
      plasma-assisted deposition technique under atmospheric pressure. The flow of the 
      dispensed liquid is driven by gravity, and the tilting angle of the device 
      determines the extent of mixing. First, a hexamethyldisiloxane film was deposited to 
      create hydrophobic patterns on glass, and then, hydrophilic acrylic acid was 
      deposited by a patterned cardboard mask to construct a channel suitable for forming 
      channels to transport aqueous liquids without the need of an external energy input; 
      the liquid can be confined to designated pathways. Several designs including 
      Y-junctions, serpentine-shaped patterns, splitting channels, and concentration 
      gradient generation patterns are presented. The proposed method can spatially 
      pattern a surface with a hydrophobic/hydrophilic area, which can function as a 
      microfluidic channel, and the surface can be applied in microfluidic devices with 
      other types of substrates.

LID - 25
AB  - Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are now being used 
      to automate the discovery of physics principles and governing equations from 
      measurement data alone. However, positing a universal physical law from data is 
      challenging without simultaneously proposing an accompanying discrepancy model to 
      account for the inevitable mismatch between theory and measurements. By revisiting 
      the classic problem of modeling falling objects of different size and mass, we 
      highlight a number of nuanced issues that must be addressed by modern data-driven 
      methods for automated physics discovery. Specifically, we show that measurement 
      noise and complex secondary physical mechanisms, like unsteady fluid drag forces, 
      can obscure the underlying law of gravitation, leading to an erroneous model. We use 
      the sparse identification of non-linear dynamics (SINDy) method to identify 
      governing equations for real-world measurement data and simulated trajectories. 
      Incorporating into SINDy the assumption that each falling object is governed by a 
      similar physical law is shown to improve the robustness of the learned models, but 
      discrepancies between the predictions and observations persist due to subtleties in 
      drag dynamics. This work highlights the fact that the naive application of ML/AI 
      will generally be insufficient to infer universal physical laws without further 
      modification.

AB  - Microfluidic cell culture is a promising technology for applications in the drug 
      screening industry. Key benefits include improved biological function, higher 
      quality cell-based data, reduced reagent consumption, and lower cost. In this work, 
      we demonstrate how a microfluidic cell culture design was adapted to be compatible 
      with the standard 96-well plate format. Key design features include the elimination 
      of tubing and connectors, the ability to maintain long term continuous perfusion 
      cell culture using a passive gravity driven pump, and direct analysis on the outlet 
      wells of the microfluidic plate. A single microfluidic culture plate contained 8 
      independent flow units, each with 10(4) cells at a flow rate of 50 μl/day (6 minute 
      residence time). The cytotoxicity of the anti-cancer drug etoposide was measured on 
      HeLa cells cultured in this format, using a commercial lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 
      plate reader assay. The integration of microfluidic cell culture methods with 
      commercial automation capabilities offers an exciting opportunity for improved 
      cell-based screening.

AB  - We report on the experimental performance of a solar aerosol reactor for carrying 
      out the combined thermochemical reduction of CeO(2) and reforming of CH(4) using 
      concentrated radiation as the source of process heat. The 2 kW(th) solar reactor 
      prototype utilizes a cavity receiver enclosing a vertical Al(2)O(3) tube which 
      contains a downward gravity-driven particle flow of ceria particles, either 
      co-current or counter-current to a CH(4) flow. Experimentation under a peak 
      radiative flux of 2264 suns yielded methane conversions up to 89% at 1300 °C for 
      residence times under 1 s. The maximum extent of ceria reduction, given by the 
      nonstoichiometry δ (CeO(2-δ)), was 0.25. The solar-to-fuel energy conversion 
      efficiency reached 12%. The syngas produced had a H(2):CO molar ratio of 2, and its 
      calorific value was solar-upgraded by 24% over that of the CH(4) reformed.

TI  - On-Chip Selective Capture and Detection of Magnetic Fingerprints of Malaria.
LID - 10.3390/s20174972 [doi]
LID - 4972
AB  - The development of innovative diagnostic tests is fundamental in the route towards 
      malaria eradication. Here, we discuss the sorting capabilities of an innovative test 
      for malaria which allows the quantitative and rapid detection of all malaria 
      species. The physical concept of the test exploits the paramagnetic property of 
      infected erythrocytes and hemozoin crystals, the magnetic fingerprints of malaria 
      common to all species, which allows them to undergo a selective magnetophoretic 
      separation driven by a magnetic field gradient in competition with gravity. Upon 
      separation, corpuscles concentrate at the surface of a silicon microchip where 
      interdigitated electrodes are placed in close proximity to magnetic concentrators. 
      The impedance variation proportional to the amount of attracted particles is then 
      measured. The capability of our test to perform the selective detection of infected 
      erythrocytes and hemozoin crystals has been tested by means of capture experiments 
      on treated bovine red blood cells, mimicking the behavior of malaria-infected ones, 
      and suspensions of synthetic hemozoin crystals. Different configuration angles of 
      the chip with respect to gravity force and different thicknesses of the microfluidic 
      chamber containing the blood sample have been investigated experimentally and by 
      multiphysics simulations. In the paper, we describe the optimum conditions leading 
      to maximum sensitivity and specificity of the test.

AB  - We present a three-dimensional morphoelastic rod model capable to describe the 
      morphogenesis of growing plant shoots driven by differential growth. We discuss the 
      evolution laws for endogenous oscillators, straightening mechanisms, and 
      reorientations to directional cues, such as gravitropic reactions governed by the 
      avalanche dynamics of statoliths. We use this model to investigate the role of 
      elastic deflections due to gravity loading in circumnutating plant shoots. We show 
      that, in the absence of endogenous cues, pendular and circular oscillations arise as 
      a critical length is attained, thus suggesting the occurrence of an instability 
      triggered by exogenous factors. When also oscillations due to endogenous cues are 
      present, their weight relative to those associated with the instability varies in 
      time as the shoot length and other biomechanical properties change. Thanks to the 
      simultaneous occurrence of these two oscillatory mechanisms, we are able to 
      reproduce a variety of complex behaviors, including trochoid-like patterns, which 
      evolve into circular orbits as the shoot length increases, and the amplitude of the 
      exogenous oscillations becomes dominant.

PG  - 061104
LID - 10.1103/PhysRevLett.122.061104 [doi]
AB  - We analyze the impact of a proposed tidal instability coupling p modes and g modes 
      within neutron stars on GW170817. This nonresonant instability transfers energy from 
      the orbit of the binary to internal modes of the stars, accelerating the 
      gravitational-wave driven inspiral. We model the impact of this instability on the 
      phasing of the gravitational wave signal using three parameters per star: an overall 
      amplitude, a saturation frequency, and a spectral index. Incorporating these 
      additional parameters, we compute the Bayes factor (lnB_{!pg}^{pg}) comparing our 
      p-g model to a standard one. We find that the observed signal is consistent with 
      waveform models that neglect p-g effects, with lnB_{!pg}^{pg}=0.03_{-0.58}^{+0.70} 
      (maximum a posteriori and 90% credible region). By injecting simulated signals that 
      do not include p-g effects and recovering them with the p-g model, we show that 
      there is a ≃50% probability of obtaining similar lnB_{!pg}^{pg} even when p-g 
      effects are absent. We find that the p-g amplitude for 1.4  M_{⊙} neutron stars is 
      constrained to less than a few tenths of the theoretical maximum, with maxima 
      a posteriori near one-tenth this maximum and p-g saturation frequency ∼70  Hz. This 
      suggests that there are less than a few hundred excited modes, assuming they all 
      saturate by wave breaking. For comparison, theoretical upper bounds suggest ≲10^{3} 
      modes saturate by wave breaking. Thus, the measured constraints only rule out 
      extreme values of the p-g parameters. They also imply that the instability 
      dissipates ≲10^{51}  erg over the entire inspiral, i.e., less than a few percent of 
      the energy radiated as gravitational waves.

AB  - Oil-water separation has recently become a worldwide concern because of the 
      increasing oil spill accidents and industrial oily wastewater generation. Herein, a 
      facile method with the combined superhydrophobic coating and adhesive was used to 
      fabricate superhydrophobic TiO(2) NPs coated cellulose sponge. The developed 
      materials exhibited excellent superhydrophobicity (WCA = 171°) and 
      superoleophilicity (OCA = 0°), which can separate a variety of oil-water mixtures, 
      including chloroform, toluene, kerosene and other contaminations. A high separation 
      efficiency up to 98.5% for chloroform-water mixture was achieved when used for 
      gravity-driven oil/water separation test. More importantly, the as-prepared samples 
      exhibited excellent chemical stability and mechanical abrasion resistance even 
      towards various corrosive oil/water mixtures (such as strong acid, alkali solution 
      and salt-water environment) or a strong abrasion by aluminium oxide sandpaper of 600 
      mesh. In addition, the separation efficiency remained above 93% even after 40 
      scratch cycles, and the materials could be reused with a stable hydrophobicity, 
      indicating a strong potential for industrial application.

TI  - Oral Microbiome in Relation to Periodontitis Severity and Systemic Inflammation.
LID - 10.3390/ijms22115876 [doi]
LID - 5876
AB  - Systemic inflammation induced by periodontitis is suggested to be the link between 
      periodontitis and cardiovascular disease. The aim of this work was to explore the 
      oral microbiome in periodontitis in relation to disease severity and systemic 
      inflammation. The saliva and subgingival microbiome from periodontal pocket samples 
      of patients with severe (n = 12) and mild periodontitis (n = 13) were analyzed using 
      metagenomic shotgun sequencing. The taxa and pathways abundances were quantified. 
      The diversity was assessed and the abundances to phenotype associations were 
      performed using ANCOM and linear regression. A panel of inflammatory markers was 
      measured in blood and was associated with taxa abundance. The microbial diversity 
      and species richness did not differ between severe and mild periodontitis in either 
      saliva or periodontal pockets. However, there were significant differences in the 
      microbial composition between severe and mild periodontitis in the subgingival 
      microbiome (i.e., pocket samples) and, in a lower grade, in saliva, and this is 
      positively associated with systemic inflammatory markers. The "red complex" and 
      "cluster B" abundances in periodontal pockets were strongly associated with 
      inflammatory markers interleukin-6 and the white blood cell count. Our data suggest 
      that systemic inflammation in severe periodontitis may be driven by the oral 
      microbiome and may support the indirect (inflammatory) mechanism for the association 
      between periodontitis and cardiovascular disease.

TI  - Potential of Melt Electrowritten Scaffolds Seeded with Meniscus Cells and 
      Mesenchymal Stromal Cells.
LID - 10.3390/ijms222011200 [doi]
LID - 11200
AB  - Meniscus injury and meniscectomy are strongly related to osteoarthritis, thus there 
      is a clinical need for meniscus replacement. The purpose of this study is to create 
      a meniscus scaffold with micro-scale circumferential and radial fibres suitable for 
      a one-stage cell-based treatment. Poly-caprolactone-based scaffolds with three 
      different architectures were made using melt electrowriting (MEW) technology and 
      their in vitro performance was compared with scaffolds made using fused-deposition 
      modelling (FDM) and with the clinically used Collagen Meniscus Implants(®) (CMI(®)). 
      The scaffolds were seeded with meniscus and mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) in 
      fibrin gel and cultured for 28 d. A basal level of proteoglycan production was 
      demonstrated in MEW scaffolds, the CMI(®), and fibrin gel control, yet within the 
      FDM scaffolds less proteoglycan production was observed. Compressive properties were 
      assessed under uniaxial confined compression after 1 and 28 d of culture. The MEW 
      scaffolds showed a higher Young's modulus when compared to the CMI(®) scaffolds and 
      a higher yield point compared to FDM scaffolds. This study demonstrates the 
      feasibility of creating a wedge-shaped meniscus scaffold with MEW using 
      medical-grade materials and seeding the scaffold with a clinically-feasible cell 
      number and -type for potential translation as a one-stage treatment.

TI  - A Microfluidic pH Measurement Device with a Flowing Liquid Junction.
LID - 10.3390/s17071563 [doi]
LID - 1563
AB  - The pH values of aqueous solutions are conventionally measured with pH-sensitive 
      electrodes such as glass electrodes or ion-sensitive field-effect transistors 
      (ISFETs) used in conjunction with Ag/AgCl reference electrodes and KCl solutions. 
      The speed of pH measurement with these systems can be deficient, however, as the 
      glass electrode responds slowly during measurements of sample solutions with low 
      buffering capacities. Our group has constructed a new pH measurement system using a 
      microfluidic device and ISFET sensors. The device has a channel with two inlets and 
      one outlet, with a junction connected to a Y-shaped channel on the same plane. Two 
      ISFET sensors and an Ag/AgCl pseudo reference electrode are fitted into the channel 
      to construct a differential measurement device. A sample solution and baseline 
      solution supplied into the inlets by gravity-driven pumps form a flowing liquid 
      junction during measurement. The small size and fast response of the ISFET sensors 
      enable measurement of about 2.0 mL of sample solution over a measurement period of 
      120 s. The 90% response time is within 2 s. The calibrated sensor signal exhibits a 
      wide range (pH 1.68-10.0) of linearity with a correlation factor of 0.9997. The 
      measurement error for all solutions tested, including diluted solutions, was 0.0343 
      ± 0.0974 pH (average error ± standard deviation (S.D.), n = 42). The new device 
      developed in this research will serve as an innovative technology in the field of 
      potentiometry.

TI  - Traction and attraction: haptotaxis substrates collagen and fibronectin interact 
      with chemotaxis by HGF to regulate myoblast migration in a microfluidic device.
PG  - C75-C92
LID - 10.1152/ajpcell.00417.2019 [doi]
AB  - Cell migration is central to development, wound healing, tissue regeneration, and 
      immunity. Despite extensive knowledge of muscle regeneration, myoblast migration 
      during regeneration is not well understood. C2C12 mouse myoblast migration and 
      morphology were investigated using a triple-docking polydimethylsiloxane-based 
      microfluidic device in which cells moved under gravity-driven laminar flow on 
      uniform (=) collagen (CN=), fibronectin (FN=), or opposing gradients (CN-FN or 
      FN-CN). In haptotaxis experiments, migration was faster on FN= than on CN=. At 10 h, 
      cells were more elongated on FN-CN and migration was faster than on the CN-FN 
      substrate. Net migration distance on FN-CN at 10 h was greater than on CN-FN, as 
      cells rapidly entered the channel as a larger population (bulk-cell movement, wave 
      1). Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) stimulated rapid chemotaxis on FN= but not CN=, 
      increasing migration speed at 10 h early in the channel at low HGF in a steep HGF 
      gradient. HGF accelerated migration on FN= and bulk-cell movement on both uniform 
      substrates. An HGF gradient also slowed cells in wave 2 moving on FN-CN, not CN-FN. 
      Both opposing-gradient substrates affected the shape, speed, and net distance of 
      migrating cells. Gradient and uniform configurations of HGF and substrate 
      differentially influenced migration behavior. Therefore, haptotaxis substrate 
      configuration potently modifies myoblast chemotaxis by HGF. Innovative microfluidic 
      experiments advance our understanding of intricate complexities of myoblast 
      migration. Findings can be leveraged to engineer muscle-tissue volumes for 
      transplantation after serious injury. New analytical approaches may generate broader 
      insights into cell migration.

TI  - Geospatial Analysis of Mass-Wasting Susceptibility of Four Small Catchments in 
      Mountainous Area of Miyun County, Beijing.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph16152801 [doi]
LID - 2801
AB  - Driven by the pull of gravity, mass-wasting comprises all of the sedimentary 
      processes related to remobilization of sediments deposited on slopes, including 
      creep, sliding, slumping, flow, and fall. It is vital to conduct mass-wasting 
      susceptibility mapping, with the aim of providing decision makers with management 
      advice. The current study presents two individual data mining methods-the frequency 
      ratio (FR) and information value model (IVM) methods-to map mass-wasting 
      susceptibility in four catchments in Miyun County, Beijing, China. To achieve this 
      goal, nine influence factors and a mass-wasting inventory map were used and 
      produced, respectively. In this study, 71 mass-wasting locations were investigated 
      in the field. Of these hazard locations, 70% of them were randomly selected to build 
      the model, and the remaining 30% of the hazard locations were used for validation. 
      Finally, a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to assess the 
      mass-wasting susceptibility maps produced by the above-mentioned models. Results 
      show that the FR had a higher concordance and spatial differentiation, with 
      respective values of 0.902 (area under the success rate) and 0.883 (area under the 
      prediction rate), while the IVM had lower values of 0.865 (area under the success 
      rate) and 0.855 (area under the prediction rate). Both proposed methodologies are 
      useful for general planning and evaluation purposes, and they are shown to be 
      reasonable models. Slopes of 6-21° were the most common thresholds that controlled 
      occurrence of mass-wasting. Farmland terraces were mainly composed of gravel, mud, 
      and clay, which are more prone to mass-wasting. Mass-wasting susceptibility mapping 
      is feasible and potentially highly valuable. It could provide useful information in 
      support of environmental health policies.

TI  - Is medicines parallel trade 'regulatory arbitrage'?
PG  - 321-336
AB  - Parallel trade (PT) is a phenomenon that takes place at the distribution level, when 
      a patented product is diverted from the official distribution chain to another one 
      where it competes as a parallel distributor. Although some research regards PT in 
      Europe as a 'common' form of arbitrage, there are reasons to believe that it is a 
      type of 'regulatory arbitrage' that does not necessarily produce equivalent welfare 
      effects. We draw upon a unique dataset that contains source country records of 
      parallel imported medicine sales to the Netherlands for one therapeutic group 
      (statins), that accounts for 5 % of the market at the time of study and it faced no 
      generic competition. We estimate precise differences in prices and statutory 
      distribution margins for each source country/product and, examine whether they drive 
      parallel import flows using a gravity specification and an instrumental variable 
      strategy. Our findings reveal that parallel imports are driven by cross-country 
      differences in statutory distribution margins in addition to price differences, 
      consistently with the hypothesis of PT being a type of 'regulatory arbitrage'.

LID - 843
AB  - Microbial biofilms in gravity-driven membrane (GDM) filtration systems can 
      efficiently degrade the cyanotoxin microcystin (MC), but it is unclear if this 
      function depends on the presence of MC-producing cyanobacteria in the source water 
      habitat. We assessed the removal of MC from added Microcystis aeruginosa biomass in 
      GDMs fed with water from a lake with regular blooms of toxic cyanobacteria (ExpL) or 
      from a stream without such background (ExpS). While initial MC removal was 
      exclusively due to abiotic processes, significantly higher biological MC removal was 
      observed in ExpL. By contrast, there was no difference in MC degradation capacity 
      between lake and stream bacteria in separately conducted liquid enrichments on pure 
      MC. Co-occurrence network analysis revealed a pronounced modularity of the biofilm 
      communities, with a clear hierarchic distinction according to feed water origin and 
      treatment type. Genotypes in the network modules associated with ExpS had 
      significantly more links to each other, indicating that these biofilms had assembled 
      from a more coherent source community. In turn, signals for stochastic community 
      assembly were stronger in ExpL biofilms. We propose that the less "tightly knit" 
      ExpL biofilm assemblages allowed for the better establishment of facultatively MC 
      degrading bacteria, and thus for higher overall functional efficiency.

PG  - 6527

LID - 6527
AB  - Fluid-sheared granular transport sculpts landscapes and undermines infrastructure, 
      yet predicting the onset of sediment transport remains notoriously unreliable. For 
      almost a century, this onset has been treated as a discontinuous transition at which 
      hydrodynamic forces overcome gravity-loaded grain-grain friction. Using a custom 
      laminar-shear flume to image slow granular dynamics deep into the bed, here we find 
      that the onset is instead a continuous transition from creeping to granular flow. 
      This transition occurs inside the dense granular bed at a critical viscous number, 
      similar to granular flows and colloidal suspensions and inconsistent with 
      hydrodynamic frameworks. We propose a new phase diagram for sediment transport, 
      where 'bed load' is a dense granular flow bounded by creep below and suspension 
      above. Creep is characteristic of disordered solids and reminiscent of soil 
      diffusion on hillslopes. Results provide new predictions for the onset and dynamics 
      of sediment transport that challenge existing models.

TI  - Self-similarity of solitary waves on inertia-dominated falling liquid films.
PG  - 033121
LID - 10.1103/PhysRevE.93.033121 [doi]
AB  - We propose consistent scaling of solitary waves on inertia-dominated falling liquid 
      films, which accurately accounts for the driving physical mechanisms and leads to a 
      self-similar characterization of solitary waves. Direct numerical simulations of the 
      entire two-phase system are conducted using a state-of-the-art finite volume 
      framework for interfacial flows in an open domain that was previously validated 
      against experimental film-flow data with excellent agreement. We present a detailed 
      analysis of the wave shape and the dispersion of solitary waves on 34 different 
      water films with Reynolds numbers Re=20-120 and surface tension coefficients 
      σ=0.0512-0.072 N m(-1) on substrates with inclination angles β=19°-90°. Following a 
      detailed analysis of these cases we formulate a consistent characterization of the 
      shape and dispersion of solitary waves, based on a newly proposed scaling derived 
      from the Nusselt flat film solution, that unveils a self-similarity as well as the 
      driving mechanism of solitary waves on gravity-driven liquid films. Our results 
      demonstrate that the shape of solitary waves, i.e., height and asymmetry of the 
      wave, is predominantly influenced by the balance of inertia and surface tension. 
      Furthermore, we find that the dispersion of solitary waves on the inertia-dominated 
      falling liquid films considered in this study is governed by nonlinear effects and 
      only driven by inertia, with surface tension and gravity having a negligible 
      influence.

      biological greywater recycling.
PG  - 100087

LID - 100087
AB  - Greywater recycling systems designed for high-quality applications, such as hand 
      washing, must deliver microbially safe and aesthetically acceptable water under the 
      challenging operating conditions present where such systems are needed most 
      urgently. As chlorination is the most popular strategy for reducing bacterial 
      concentrations in greywater, understanding chlorination in the context of disruptive 
      and challenging operation is essential to designing robust treatment. In this study, 
      we have examined how disruptions through overall increased loading, interrupted 
      aeration and increased ammonia loading have impacted the chlorine demand of the 
      water produced by a greywater recycling system. We also presented concentrations of 
      significant chemicals that contributed to this chlorine demand. The results indicate 
      that a 1 d period with 8 times (8x) the normal design loading produced a peak 
      chlorine demand of 0.74 mg Cl(2)/L, which is approximately double the baseline 
      value. While this chlorine demand can be overcome by adding more chlorine, tests 
      involving disruptions in aeration or feeding additional ammonia into the bioreactor 
      produced much greater increases (>30x). The risks of increased chlorine demand on 
      microbial safety can be overcome by limiting ammonia inputs to the system, providing 
      backup systems to ensure sufficient aeration, or through additional anti-bacterial 
      measures that do not depend on maintaining residual chlorine.

TI  - Inactivation of semicircular canals causes adaptive increases in otolith-driven tilt 
      responses.
PG  - 1635-40
AB  - Growing experimental and theoretical evidence suggests a functional synergy in the 
      processing of otolith and semicircular canal signals for the generation of the 
      vestibulo-ocular reflexes (VORs). In this study we have further tested this 
      functional interaction by quantifying the adaptive changes in the otolith-ocular 
      system during both rotational and translational movements after surgical 
      inactivation of the semicircular canals. For 0.1-0.5 Hz (stimuli for which there is 
      no recovery of responses from the plugged canals), pitch and roll VOR gains 
      recovered during earth-horizontal (but not earth-vertical) axis rotations. 
      Corresponding changes were also observed in eye movements elicited by translational 
      motion (0.1-5 Hz). Specifically, torsional eye movements increased during lateral 
      motion, whereas vertical eye movements increased during fore-aft motion. The 
      findings indicate that otolith signals can be adapted according to a compromised 
      strategy that leads to improved gaze stabilization during motion. Because 
      canal-plugged animals permanently lose the ability to discriminate gravitoinertial 
      accelerations, adapted animals can use the presence of gravity through 
      otolith-driven tilt responses to assist gaze stabilization during earth-horizontal 
      axis rotations.

TI  - Simulating droplet motion on virtual leaf surfaces.
PG  - 140528
LID - 10.1098/rsos.140528 [doi]
LID - 140528
AB  - A curvilinear thin film model is used to simulate the motion of droplets on a 
      virtual leaf surface, with a view to better understand the retention of agricultural 
      sprays on plants. The governing model, adapted from Roy et al. (2002 J. Fluid Mech. 
      454, 235-261 (doi:10.1017/S0022112001007133)) with the addition of a disjoining 
      pressure term, describes the gravity- and curvature-driven flow of a small droplet 
      on a complex substrate: a cotton leaf reconstructed from digitized scan data. 
      Coalescence is the key mechanism behind spray coating of foliage, and our 
      simulations demonstrate that various experimentally observed coalescence behaviours 
      can be reproduced qualitatively. By varying the contact angle over the domain, we 
      also demonstrate that the presence of a chemical defect can act as an obstacle to 
      the droplet's path, causing break-up. In simulations on the virtual leaf, it is 
      found that the movement of a typical spray size droplet is driven almost exclusively 
      by substrate curvature gradients. It is not until droplet mass is sufficiently 
      increased via coalescence that gravity becomes the dominating force.

TI  - The Neuro-Mechanical Processes That Underlie Goal-Directed Medio-Lateral APA during 
      Gait Initiation.
PG  - 445
LID - 10.3389/fnhum.2016.00445 [doi]
LID - 445
AB  - Gait initiation (GI) involves passing from bipedal to unipedal stance. It requires a 
      rapid movement of the center of foot pressure (CoP) towards the future swing foot 
      and of the center of mass (CoM) in the direction of the stance foot prior to the 
      incoming step. This anticipatory postural adjustment (APA) allows disengaging the 
      swing leg from the ground and establishing favorable conditions for stepping. This 
      study aimed to describe the neuro-mechanical process that underlies the 
      goal-directed medio-lateral (ML) APA. We hypothesized that controlled knee flexion 
      of the stance leg contributes to the initial ML displacement of the CoP and to the 
      calibration of the first step. Fourteen subjects initiated gait starting from three 
      different initial stance widths of 15 cm (Small), 30 cm (Medium), and 45 cm (Large). 
      Optoelectronic, force platform and electromyogram (EMG) measurements were performed. 
      During APA, soleus activity diminished bilaterally, while tibialis anterior (TA) 
      activity increased, more so in the stance leg than in the swing leg, and to a larger 
      extent with increasing initial stance width. Knee flexion of the stance leg was 
      observed during APA and correlated with the ML CoP displacement towards the swing 
      leg. ML CoP and CoM displacements during APA increased with increasing stance width. 
      The activity of stance-leg TA was correlated with the degree of knee flexion. 
      Swing-leg tensor fasciae latae (TFL) was also active during APA. Across subjects, 
      when stance-leg tibialis activity was low, TFL activity was large and vice versa. 
      The modulation of the ML CoP position during APA allowed the gravity-driven torque 
      to place the CoM just lateral to the stance foot during step execution. Accordingly, 
      the gravity-driven torque, the ML CoM velocity during step execution, and the step 
      width at foot contact (FC) were lower in the Small and greater in the Large 
      condition. Consequently, the position of the stepping foot at FC remained close to 
      the sagittal plane in all three conditions. Conclusively, coordinated activation of 
      hip abductors and ankle dorsiflexors during APA displaces the CoP towards the swing 
      leg, and sets the contact position for the swing foot.

TI  - Local Dot Motion, Not Global Configuration, Determines Dogs' Preference for 
      Point-Light Displays.
LID - 10.3390/ani9090661 [doi]
LID - 661
AB  - Visual perception remains an understudied area of dog cognition, particularly the 
      perception of biological motion where the small amount of previous research has 
      created an unclear impression regarding dogs' visual preference towards different 
      types of point-light displays. To date, no thorough investigation has been conducted 
      regarding which aspects of the motion contained in point-light displays attract 
      dogs. To test this, pet dogs (N = 48) were presented with pairs of point-light 
      displays with systematic manipulation of motion features (i.e., upright or inverted 
      orientation, coherent or scrambled configuration, human or dog species). Results 
      revealed a significant effect of inversion, with dogs directing significantly longer 
      looking time towards upright than inverted dog point-light displays; no effect was 
      found for scrambling or the scrambling-inversion interaction. No looking time bias 
      was found when dogs were presented with human point-light displays, regardless of 
      their orientation or configuration. The results of the current study imply that 
      dogs' visual preference is driven by the motion of individual dots in accordance 
      with gravity, rather than the point-light display's global arrangement, regardless 
      their long exposure to human motion.

      Malaria Parasites.
PG  - 36808
LID - 10.1038/srep36808 [doi]
LID - 36808
AB  - Isothermal nucleic acid amplification assays such as the loop mediated isothermal 
      amplification (LAMP), are well suited for field use as they do not require thermal 
      cyclers to amplify the DNA. To further facilitate the use of LAMP assays in remote 
      settings, simpler sample preparation methods and lyophilized reagents are required. 
      The performance of a commercial malaria LAMP assay (Illumigene Malaria LAMP) was 
      evaluated using two sample preparation workflows (simple filtration prep (SFP)) and 
      gravity-driven filtration prep (GFP)) and pre-dispensed lyophilized reagents. 
      Laboratory and clinical samples were tested in a field laboratory in Senegal and the 
      results independently confirmed in a reference laboratory in the U.S.A. The 
      Illumigene Malaria LAMP assay was easily implemented in the clinical laboratory and 
      gave similar results to a real-time PCR reference test with limits of detection of 
      ≤2.0 parasites/μl depending on the sample preparation method used. This assay 
      reliably detected Plasmodium sp. parasites in a simple low-tech format, providing a 
      much needed alternative to the more complex molecular tests for malaria diagnosis.

TI  - Online fluorescence anisotropy immunoassay for monitoring insulin secretion from 
      islets of Langerhans.
PG  - 38-45
LID - 10.1039/C6AY02899C [doi]
AB  - Insulin secretion from islets of Langerhans is a dynamic process that is essential 
      for maintaining glucose homeostasis. The ability to measure dynamic changes in 
      insulin levels upon glucose stimulation from single islets will allow testing of 
      therapeutics and investigating mechanisms of defective secretion observed in 
      metabolic diseases. Most approaches to date for measurement of rapid changes in 
      insulin levels rely on separations, making the assays difficult to translate to 
      non-specialist laboratories. To enable rapid measurements of secretion dynamics from 
      a single islet in a manner that will be more suitable for transfer to 
      non-specialized laboratories, a microfluidic online fluorescence anisotropy 
      immunoassay was developed. A single islet was housed inside a microfluidic chamber 
      and stimulated with varying glucose levels from a gravity-based perfusion system. 
      The total effluent of the islet chamber containing the islet secretions was mixed 
      with gravity-driven solutions of insulin antibody and Cy5-labeled insulin. After 
      mixing was complete, a linearly polarized 635 nm laser was used to excite the 
      immunoassay mixture and the emission was split into parallel and perpendicular 
      components for determination of anisotropy. Key factors for reproducible anisotropy 
      measurements, including temperature homogeneity and flow rate stability were 
      optimized, which resulted in a 4 nM limit of detection for insulin with <1% RSD of 
      anisotropy values. The capability of this system for measuring insulin secretion 
      from single islets was shown by stimulating an islet with varying glucose levels. As 
      the entire analysis is performed optically, this system should be readily 
      transferable to other laboratories.

TI  - Measurements of Submicron Particle Adsorption and Particle Film Elasticity at 
      Oil-Water Interfaces.
PG  - 4125-33
LID - 10.1021/acs.langmuir.5b04586 [doi]
AB  - The influence of particle adsorption on liquid/liquid interfacial tension is not 
      well understood, and much previous research has suggested conflicting behaviors. In 
      this paper we investigate the surface activity and adsorption kinetics of charge 
      stabilized and pH-responsive polymer stabilized colloids at oil/water interfaces 
      using two tensiometry techniques: (i) pendant drop and (ii) microtensiometer. We 
      found, using both techniques, that charge stabilized particles had little or no 
      influence on the (dynamic) interfacial tension, although dense silica particles 
      affected the "apparent" measured tension in the pendent drop, due to gravity driven 
      elongation of the droplet profile. Nevertheless, this apparent change additionally 
      allowed the study of adsorption kinetics, which was related qualitatively between 
      particle systems by estimated diffusion coefficients. Significant and real 
      interfacial tension responses were measured using ∼53 nm core-shell latex particles 
      with a pH-responsive polymer stabilizer of poly(methyl 
      methacrylate)-b-poly(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) (pMMA-b-pDMAEMA) diblock 
      copolymer. At pH 2, where the polymer is strongly charged, behavior was similar to 
      that of the bare charge-stabilized particles, showing little change in the 
      interfacial tension. At pH 10, where the polymer is discharged and poorly soluble in 
      water, a significant decrease in the measured interfacial tension commensurate with 
      strong adsorption at the oil-water interface was seen, which was similar in 
      magnitude to the surface activity of the free polymer. These results were both 
      confirmed through droplet profile and microtensiometry experiments. Dilational 
      elasticity measurements were also performed by oscillation of the droplet; again, 
      changes in interfacial tension with droplet oscillation were only seen with the 
      responsive particles at pH 10. Frequency sweeps were performed to ascertain the 
      dilational elasticity modulus, with measured values being significantly higher than 
      previously reported for nanoparticle and surfactant systems, and similar in 
      magnitude to protein stabilized droplets.

TI  - Effects of Emulsion Composition on Pulmonary Tobramycin Delivery During 
      Antibacterial Perfluorocarbon Ventilation.
PG  - 251-9
LID - 10.1089/jamp.2015.1235 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of inhaled aerosolized antibiotics is limited by poor 
      ventilation of infected airways. Pulmonary delivery of antibiotics emulsified within 
      liquid perfluorocarbon [antibacterial perfluorocarbon ventilation (APV)] may solve 
      this problem through better airway penetration and improved spatial uniformity. 
      However, little work has been done to explore emulsion formulation and the 
      corresponding effects on drug delivery during APV. This study investigated the 
      effects of emulsion formulation on emulsion stability and the pharmacokinetics of 
      antibiotic delivery via APV. METHODS: Gravity-driven phase separation was examined 
      in vitro by measuring emulsion tobramycin concentrations at varying heights within a 
      column of emulsion over 4 hours for varying values of fluorosurfactant concentration 
      (Cfs = 5-48 mg/mL H2O). Serum and pulmonary tobramycin concentrations in rats were 
      then evaluated following pulmonary tobramycin delivery via aerosol or APV utilizing 
      sufficiently stable emulsions of varying aqueous volume percentage (Vaq = 1%-5%), 
      aqueous tobramycin concentration (Ct = 20-100 mg/mL), and Cfs (15 and 48 mg/mL H2O). 
      RESULTS: In vitro assessment showed sufficient spatial and temporal uniformity of 
      tobramycin dispersion within emulsion for Cfs ≥15 mg/mL H2O, while lower Cfs values 
      showed insufficient emulsification even immediately following preparation. APV with 
      stable emulsion formulations resulted in 5-22 times greater pulmonary tobramycin 
      concentrations at 4 hours post-delivery relative to aerosolized delivery. 
      Concentrations increased with emulsion formulations utilizing increased Vaq (with 
      decreased Ct) and, to a lesser extent, increased Cfs. CONCLUSIONS: The emulsion 
      stability necessary for effective delivery is retained at Cfs values as low as 
      15 mg/mL H2O. Additionally, the pulmonary retention of antibiotic delivered via APV 
      is significantly greater than that of aerosolized delivery and can be most 
      effectively increased by increasing Vaq and decreasing Ct. APV has been further 
      proven as an effective means of pulmonary drug delivery with the potential to 
      significantly improve antibiotic therapy for lung disease patients.

TI  - Superhydrophobic PDMS-pCA@CNWF Composite with UV-Resistant and Self-Cleaning 
      Properties for Oil/Water Separation.
LID - 10.3390/ma15010376 [doi]
LID - 376
AB  - Oil separation is crucial for avoiding environmental pollution originating from 
      industrial wastewater and oil spillage; therefore, it is essential to develop 
      techniques for oil separation. Herein, a new membrane with superhydrophilicity was 
      synthesized by a facile, green, and low-cost method. First, cellulose non-woven 
      fabric (CNWF) was modified by poly (catechin) (pCA), which has good antioxidant and 
      antibacterial activities, to make it unaffected by ultraviolet light and to improve 
      the stability of the structure. Then, hydrolyzed polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) was 
      coated on the pCA@CNWF surface via chemical bonding to make the composite 
      hydrophobic. This durable superhydrophobic fabric can be used to separate various 
      oil/water mixtures by gravity-driven forces with high separation efficiency (over 
      98.9%). Additionally, the PDMS-pCA@CNWF possesses the advantages of flexibility, 
      high efficiency, and an outstanding self-cleaning performance, and demonstrates 
      significant potential for applications in various environments, even under various 
      harsh conditions, which make it very promising for the treatment of oil pollution in 
      practical applications.

TI  - Bio-Inspired Take-Off Maneuver and Control in Vertical Jumping for Quadruped Robot 
      with Manipulator.
LID - 10.3390/mi12101189 [doi]
LID - 1189
AB  - The jumping motion of legged robots is an effective way to overcome obstacles in the 
      rugged microgravity planetary exploration environment. At the same time, a quadruped 
      robot with a manipulator can achieve operational tasks during movement, which is 
      more practical. However, the additional manipulator will restrict the jumping 
      ability of the quadruped robot due to the increase in the weight of the system, and 
      more active degrees of freedom will increase the control complexity. To improve the 
      jumping height of a quadruped robot with a manipulator, a bio-inspired take-off 
      maneuver based on the coordination of upper and lower limbs is proposed in this 
      paper. The kinetic energy and potential energy of the system are increased by 
      driving the manipulator-end (ME) to swing upward, and the torso driven by the legs 
      will delay reaching the required peak speed due to the additional load caused by the 
      accelerated ME. When the acceleration of ME is less than zero, it will pull the body 
      upward, which reduces the peak power of the leg joints. Therefore, the jumping 
      ability of the system is improved. To realize continuous and stable jumping, a 
      control framework based on whole-body control was established, in which the 
      quadruped robot with a manipulator was a simplified floating seven-link model, and 
      the hierarchical optimization was used to solve the target joint torques. This 
      method greatly simplifies the dynamic model and is convenient for calculation. 
      Finally, the jumping simulations in different gravity environments and a 15° slope 
      were performed. The jump heights have all been improved after adding the arm swing, 
      which verified the superiority of the bio-inspired take-off maneuver proposed in 
      this paper. Furthermore, the stability of the jumping control method was testified 
      by the continuous and stable jumping.

AB  - We describe an expanded modular gastrointestinal (GI) tract-liver system by 
      co-culture of primary human intestinal epithelial cells (hIECs) and 3D liver mimic. 
      The two organ body-on-chip design consisted of GI and liver tissue compartments that 
      were connected by fluidic medium flow driven via gravity. The hIECs and HepG2 C3A 
      liver cells in the co-culture system maintained high viability for at least 14 days 
      in which hIECs differentiated into major cell types found in native human intestinal 
      epithelium and the HepG2 C3A cells cultured on 3D polymer scaffold formed a liver 
      micro-lobe like structure. Moreover, the hIECs formed a monolayer on polycarbonate 
      membranes with a tight junction and authentic TEER values of approximately 250 Ω cm2 
      for the native gut. The hIEC permeability was compared to a conventional 
      permeability model using Caco-2 cell response for drug absorption by measuring the 
      uptake of propranolol, mannitol and caffeine. Metabolic rates (urea or albumin 
      production) of the cells in the co-culture GI-liver system were comparable to those 
      of HepG2 C3A cells in a single-organ fluidic culture system, while induced CYP 
      activities were significantly increased in the co-culture GI tract-liver system 
      compared to the single-organ fluidic culture system. These results demonstrated 
      potential of the low-cost microphysiological GI-liver model for preclinical studies 
      to predict human response.

AB  - Long-running gravity currents are flows that are submerged beneath a deep layer of 
      quiescent fluid and they travel over long distances along inclined or horizontal 
      surfaces. They are driven by the density difference between the current and the 
      clear ambient fluid above. In this work we present results on highly resolved direct 
      numerical simulations of turbid underflows that involve nearly 1 billion degrees of 
      freedom. We assess the effect of bed slope on the flow statistics. We explore the 
      turbulence dynamics of the interface in the classical sub- and supercritical 
      regimes. We investigate the structure of interfacial turbulence and its relation to 
      the turbulence statistic. A transcritical regime is identified where intermittent 
      cascading interfacial instabilities appear. We investigate how departure from the 
      self-sustaining equilibrium state may be the mechanism responsible for this cyclic 
      evolution of the transcritical regime.

AB  - Ocular counter-rolling (OCR) is a reflex generated by the activation of the gravity 
      sensors in the inner ear that stabilizes gaze and posture during head tilt. We 
      compared the OCR measures that were obtained in 6 astronauts before, during, and 
      after a spaceflight lasting 4-6 days with the OCR measures obtained from 6 
      astronauts before and after a spaceflight lasting 4-9 months. OCR in the 
      short-duration fliers was measured using the afterimage method during head tilt at 
      15°, 30°, and 45°. OCR in the long-duration fliers was measured using 
      video-oculography during whole body tilt at 25°. A control group of 7 subjects was 
      used to compare OCR measures during head tilt and whole body tilt. No OCR occurred 
      during head tilt in microgravity, and the response returned to normal within 2 hours 
      of return from short-duration spaceflight. However, the amplitude of OCR was reduced 
      for several days after return from long-duration spaceflight. This decrease in 
      amplitude was not accompanied by changes in the asymmetry of OCR between right and 
      left head tilt. These results indicate that the adaptation  of otolith-driven 
      reflexes to microgravity is a long-duration process.

TI  - Reflection from the strong gravity regime in a lensed quasar at redshift z = 0.658.
PG  - 207-9
LID - 10.1038/nature13031 [doi]
AB  - The co-evolution of a supermassive black hole with its host galaxy through cosmic 
      time is encoded in its spin. At z > 2, supermassive black holes are thought to grow 
      mostly by merger-driven accretion leading to high spin. It is not known, however, 
      whether below z ≈ 1 these black holes continue to grow by coherent accretion or in a 
      chaotic manner, though clear differences are predicted in their spin evolution. An 
      established method of measuring the spin of black holes is through the study of 
      relativistic reflection features from the inner accretion disk. Owing to their 
      greater distances from Earth, there has hitherto been no significant detection of 
      relativistic reflection features in a moderate-redshift quasar. Here we report an 
      analysis of archival X-ray data together with a deep observation of a 
      gravitationally lensed quasar at z = 0.658. The emission originates within three or 
      fewer gravitational radii from the black hole, implying a spin parameter (a measure 
      of how fast the black hole is rotating) of a = 0.87(+0.08)(-0.15) at the 3σ 
      confidence level and a > 0.66 at the 5σ level. The high spin found here is 
      indicative of growth by coherent accretion for this black hole, and suggests that 
      black-hole growth at 0.5 ≤ z ≤ 1 occurs principally by coherent rather than chaotic 
      accretion episodes.

LID - 4903
AB  - The morphological development of fluvial and tidal systems is forecast more and more 
      frequently by models in scientific and engineering studies for decision making 
      regarding climate change mitigation, flood control, navigation and engineering 
      works. However, many existing morphodynamic models predict unrealistically high 
      channel incision, which is often dampened by increased gravity-driven sediment 
      transport on side-slopes by up to two orders of magnitude too high. Here we show 
      that such arbitrary calibrations dramatically bias sediment dynamics, channel 
      patterns, and rate of morphological change. For five different models bracketing a 
      range of scales and environments, we found that it is impossible to calibrate a 
      model on both sediment transport magnitude and morphology. Consequently, present 
      calibration practice may cause an order magnitude error in either morphology or 
      morphological change. We show how model design can be optimized for different 
      applications. We discuss the major implications for model interpretation and a 
      critical knowledge gap.

TI  - The residue I257 at S4-S5 linker in KCNQ1 determines KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel sensitivity 
      to 1-alkanols.
PG  - 124-33
LID - 10.1038/aps.2015.133 [doi]
AB  - AIM: KCNQ1 and KCNE1 form a complex in human ventricular cardiomyocytes, which are 
      important in maintaining a normal heart rhythm. In the present study we investigated 
      the effects of a homologous series of 1-alkanols on KCNQ1/KCNE1 channels expressed 
      in Xenopus oocytes. METHODS: ECG recording was made in rats injected with 
      ethanol-containing solution (0.3 mL, ip). Human KCNQ1 channel and its auxiliary 
      subunit KCNE1 were heterologously coexpressed in Xenopus oocytes, which were 
      superfused with ND96 solution; 1-alkanols (ethanol, 1-butanol and 1-hexanol) were 
      delivered through a gravity-driven perfusion device. The slow-delayed rectifier 
      potassium currents IKs (KCNQ1/KCNE1 currents) were recorded using a two-electrode 
      voltage clamp method. Site-directed mutations (I257A) were made in KCNQ1. RESULTS: 
      In ECG recordings, a low concentration of ethanol (3%, v/v) slightly increased the 
      heart rate of rats, whereas the higher concentrations of ethanol (10%, 50%, v/v) 
      markedly reduced it. In oocytes coexpressing KCNQ1/KCNE1 channels, ethanol, 
      1-butanol and 1-hexanol dose-dependently inhibited IKs currents with IC50 values of 
      80, 11 and 2.7 mmol/L, respectively. Furthermore, the 1-alkanols blocked the KCNQ1 
      channel in both open and closed states, and a four-state model could adequately 
      explain the effects of 1-alkanols on the closed-state channel block. Moreover, the 
      mutation of I257A at the intracellular loop between S4 and S5 in KCNQ1 greatly 
      decreased the sensitivity to 1-alkanols; and the IC50 values of ethanol, 1-butanol 
      and 1-hexanol were increased to 634, 414 and 7.4 mmol/L, respectively. The mutation 
      also caused the ablation of closed-state channel block. CONCLUSION: These findings 
      provide new insight into the intricate mechanisms of the blocking effects of ethanol 
      on the KCNQ1 channel.

      both upwards and downwards by staggering the wires on both sides. In order to 
      estimate and control torque via motor current without a force/torque sensor, the 
      gravity model and friction model of the device are derived through repeated 
      experiments. The LuGre model is applied to the friction model, and the static and 
      dynamic parameters are obtained using a curve fitting function and a genetic 
      algorithm. Direct teaching control is designed using a force-free control algorithm 
      that compensates for the estimated torque from the motor current for gravity and 
      friction, and then converts it into a position control input. Direct teaching 
      operation sensitivity is verified through hand-guiding experiments.

AB  - Previous analysis on the lateral stability of hovering insects, which reported a 
      destabilizing roll moment due to a lateral gust, has relied on the results of a 
      single wing without considering a presence of the contralateral wing (wing-wing 
      interaction). Here, we investigated the presence of the contralateral wing on the 
      aerodynamic and flight dynamic characteristics of a hovering hawkmoth under a 
      lateral gust. By employing a dynamically scaled-up mechanical model and a 
      servo-driven towing system installed in a water tank, we found that the presence of 
      the contralateral wing plays a significant role in the lateral static stability. The 
      contralateral wing mitigated an excessive aerodynamic force on the wing at the 
      leeward side, thereby providing a negative roll moment to the body. Digital particle 
      image velocimetry revealed an attenuated vortical system of the leading-edge vortex. 
      An excessive effective angle of attack in the single wing case, which was caused by 
      the root vortex of previous half stroke, was reduced by a downwash of the 
      contralateral wing. The contralateral wing also relocated a neutral point in close 
      proximity to the wing hinge points above the actual center of gravity, providing a 
      practical static margin to a hovering hawkmoth.

TI  - Mineralogy and heavy metal assessment of the Pietra del Pertusillo reservoir 
      sediments (Southern Italy).
PG  - 4857-4878
LID - 10.1007/s11356-020-10829-6 [doi]
AB  - The Pietra del Pertusillo freshwater reservoir is a major artificial lake of 
      environmental, biological, and ecological importance located in the Basilicata 
      region, southern Italy. The reservoir arch-gravity dam was completed in 1963 for 
      producing hydroelectric energy and providing water for human use, and nearby there 
      are potential sources of anthropogenic pollution such as urban and industrial 
      activities. For the first time, the minero-chemistry of the lake and 
      fluvio-lacustrine sediments of the reservoir have been evaluated to assess the 
      environmental quality. Moreover, the composition of fluvial sediments derived from 
      the peri-lacual zone of the reservoir and of local outcropping bedrock were also 
      studied to understand the factors affecting the behavior of elements in the 
      freshwater reservoir, with particular attention paid to heavy metals. In Italy, 
      specific regulatory values concerning the element threshold concentration for lake 
      and river sediments do not exist, and for this reason, soil threshold values are 
      considered the standard for sediments of internal waters. The evaluation of the 
      environmental quality of reservoir sediments has been performed using enrichment 
      factors obtained with respect to the average composition of a reconstructed local 
      upper continental crust. We suggest this method as an innovative standard in similar 
      conditions worldwide. In the studied reservoir sediments, the trace elements that 
      may be of some environmental concern are Cr, Cu, Zn, As, and Pb although, at this 
      stage, the distribution of these elements appears to be mostly driven by geogenic 
      processes. However, within the frame of the assessment and the preservation of the 
      quality of aquatic environments, particular attention has to be paid to As (which 
      shows median value of 10 ppm, reaching a maximum value of 26 ppm in Quaternary 
      sediments), constantly enriched in the lacustrine samples and especially in the 
      fine-grained fraction (median = 8.5 ppm).

TI  - Integrated perfusion and separation systems for entrainment of insulin secretion 
      from islets of Langerhans.
PG  - 823-32
LID - 10.1039/c4lc01360c [doi]
AB  - A microfluidic system was developed to investigate the entrainment of insulin 
      secretion from islets of Langerhans to oscillatory glucose levels. A gravity-driven 
      perfusion system was integrated with a microfluidic system to deliver sinusoidal 
      glucose waveforms to the islet chamber. Automated manipulation of the height of the 
      perfusion syringes allowed precise control of the ratio of two perfusion solutions 
      into a chamber containing 1-10 islets. Insulin levels in the perfusate were measured 
      using an online competitive electrophoretic immunoassay with a sampling period of 10 
      s. The insulin immunoassay had a detection limit of 3 nM with RSDs of calibration 
      points ranging from 2-8%. At 11 mM glucose, insulin secretion from single islets was 
      oscillatory with a period ranging from 3-6 min. Application of a small amplitude 
      sinusoidal wave of glucose with a period of 5 or 10 min, shifted the period of the 
      insulin oscillations to this forcing period. Exposing groups of 6-10 islets to a 
      sinusoidal glucose wave synchronized their behavior, producing a coherent pulsatile 
      insulin response from the population. These results demonstrate the feasibility of 
      the developed system for the study of oscillatory insulin secretion and can be 
      easily modified for investigating the dynamic nature of other hormones released from 
      different cell types.

TI  - Taking the body off the mind: Decreased functional connectivity between somatomotor 
      and default-mode networks following Floatation-REST.
PG  - 3216-3227
LID - 10.1002/hbm.25429 [doi]
AB  - Floatation-Reduced Environmental Stimulation Therapy (REST) is a procedure that 
      reduces stimulation of the human nervous system by minimizing sensory signals from 
      visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory, thermal, tactile, vestibular, gravitational, 
      and proprioceptive channels, in addition to minimizing musculoskeletal movement and 
      speech. Initial research has found that Floatation-REST can elicit short-term 
      reductions in anxiety, depression, and pain, yet little is known about the brain 
      networks impacted by the intervention. This study represents the first functional 
      neuroimaging investigation of Floatation-REST, and we utilized a data-driven 
      exploratory analysis to determine whether the intervention leads to altered patterns 
      of resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC). Healthy participants underwent 
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) before and after 90 min of 
      Floatation-REST or a control condition that entailed resting supine in a 
      zero-gravity chair for an equivalent amount of time. Multivariate Distance Matrix 
      Regression (MDMR), a statistically-stringent whole-brain searchlight approach, 
      guided subsequent seed-based connectivity analyses of the resting-state fMRI data. 
      MDMR identified peak clusters of rsFC change between the pre- and post-float fMRI, 
      revealing significant decreases in rsFC both within and between posterior hubs of 
      the default-mode network (DMN) and a large swath of cortical tissue encompassing the 
      primary and secondary somatomotor cortices extending into the posterior insula. The 
      control condition, an active form of REST, showed a similar pattern of reduced rsFC. 
      Thus, reduced stimulation of the nervous system appears to be reflected by reduced 
      rsFC within the brain networks most responsible for creating and mapping our sense 
      of self.

AB  - We present an experimental study on opto-thermal oscillation and trapping of light 
      absorbing particles. The oscillation is a three-dimensional motion in the solution. 
      The particles at the lower substrate of the sample cell are driven towards the 
      center of optical trap by the optical force. When the particles arrive at the 
      location near the trap center, the laser heating on the particles results in a 
      strong thermal gradient force that repels the particles to leave the focus spot. 
      Next, the particles slow down under the viscous drag force. At last, the particles 
      settle to the lower substrate of sample cell due to gravity, and restart the new 
      oscillation process. For opto-thermal trapping of the absorbing particles, the 
      particles are dispersed in a thin cell to compress the convention and enhance the 
      viscous resistance. The particles can be trapped close to the spot due to the 
      balance of optical and thermal gradient forces.

TI  - Deposition of Particles in the Alveolar Airways: Inhalation and Breath-Hold with 
      Pharmaceutical Aerosols.
PG  - 15-30
AB  - Previous studies have demonstrated that factors such as airway wall motion, 
      inhalation waveform, and geometric complexity influence the deposition of aerosols 
      in the alveolar airways. However, deposition fraction correlations are not available 
      that account for these factors in determining alveolar deposition. The objective of 
      this study was to generate a new space-filling model of the pulmonary acinus region 
      and implement this model to develop correlations of aerosol deposition that can be 
      used to predict the alveolar dose of inhaled pharmaceutical products. A series of 
      acinar models was constructed containing different numbers of alveolar duct 
      generations based on space-filling 14-hedron elements. Selected ventilation 
      waveforms were quick-and-deep and slow-and-deep inhalation consistent with the use 
      of most pharmaceutical aerosol inhalers. Computational fluid dynamics simulations 
      were used to predict aerosol transport and deposition in the series of acinar models 
      across various orientations with gravity where ventilation was driven by wall 
      motion. Primary findings indicated that increasing the number of alveolar duct 
      generations beyond 3 had a negligible impact on total acinar deposition, and total 
      acinar deposition was not affected by gravity orientation angle. A characteristic 
      model containing three alveolar duct generations (D3) was then used to develop 
      correlations of aerosol deposition in the alveolar airways as a function of particle 
      size and particle residence time in the geometry. An alveolar deposition parameter 
      was determined in which deposition correlated with d(2)t over the first half of 
      inhalation followed by correlation with dt(2), where d is the aerodynamic diameter 
      of the particles and t is the potential particle residence time in the alveolar 
      model. Optimal breath-hold times to allow 95% deposition of inhaled 1, 2, and 3 μm 
      particles once inside the alveolar region were approximately >10, 2.7, and 1.2 s, 
      respectively. Coupling of the deposition correlations with previous stochastic 
      individual path (SIP) model predictions of tracheobronchial deposition was 
      demonstrated to predict alveolar dose of commercial pharmaceutical products. In 
      conclusion, this study completes an initiative to determine the fate of inhaled 
      pharmaceutical aerosols throughout the respiratory airways using CFD simulations.

TI  - Sequencing Batch Integrated Fixed-Film Activated Sludge Membrane Process for 
      Treatment of Tapioca Processing Wastewater.
LID - 10.3390/membranes11110875 [doi]
LID - 875
AB  - Tapioca processing industries are very popular in the rural community to produce a 
      variety of foods as the end products. Due to their small scales and scattered 
      locations, they require robust modular systems to operate at low capacity with 
      minimum supervision. This study explores the application of a novel sequencing 
      batch-integrated fixed-film activated sludge membrane (SB-IFASM) process to treat 
      tapioca processing wastewater for reuse purposes. The SB-IFASM employed a 
      gravity-driven system and utilizes biofilm to enhance biodegradation without 
      requiring membrane cleaning. The SB-IFASM utilizes the biofilm as a secondary 
      biodegradation stage to enhance the permeate quality applicable for reuse. A 
      lab-scale SB-IFASM was developed, preliminarily assessed, and used to treat 
      synthetic tapioca processing industry wastewater. The results of short-term 
      filtration tests showed the significant impact of hydrostatic pressure on membrane 
      compaction and instant cake layer formation. Increasing the pressure from 2.2 to 10 
      kPa lowered the permeability of clean water and activated sludge from 720 to 425 and 
      from 110 to 50 L/m(2)·h bar, respectively. The unsteady-state operation of the 
      SB-IFASM showed the prominent role of the bio-cake in removing the organics reaching 
      the permeate quality suitable for reuse. High COD removals of 63-98% demonstrated 
      the prominence contribution of the biofilm in enhancing biological performance and 
      ultimate COD removals of >93% make it very attractive for application in small-scale 
      tapioca processing industries. However, the biological ecosystem was unstable, as 
      shown by foaming that deteriorated permeability and was detrimental to the organic 
      removal. Further developments are still required, particularly to address the 
      biological stability and low permeability.

TI  - Amyloplast displacement is necessary for gravisensing in Arabidopsis shoots as 
      revealed by a centrifuge microscope.
PG  - 648-60
LID - 10.1111/tpj.12324 [doi]
AB  - The starch-statolith hypothesis proposes that starch-filled amyloplasts act as 
      statoliths in plant gravisensing, moving in response to the gravity vector and 
      signaling its direction. However, recent studies suggest that amyloplasts show 
      continuous, complex movements in Arabidopsis shoots, contradicting the idea of a 
      so-called 'static' or 'settled' statolith. Here, we show that amyloplast movement 
      underlies shoot gravisensing by using a custom-designed centrifuge microscope in 
      combination with analysis of gravitropic mutants. The centrifuge microscope revealed 
      that sedimentary movements of amyloplasts under hypergravity conditions are linearly 
      correlated with gravitropic curvature in wild-type stems. We next analyzed the 
      hypergravity response in the shoot gravitropism 2 (sgr2) mutant, which exhibits 
      neither a shoot gravitropic response nor amyloplast sedimentation at 1 g. sgr2 
      mutants were able to sense and respond to gravity under 30 g conditions, during 
      which the amyloplasts sedimented. These findings are consistent with amyloplast 
      redistribution resulting from gravity-driven movements triggering shoot 
      gravisensing. To further support this idea, we examined two additional gravitropic 
      mutants, phosphoglucomutase (pgm) and sgr9, which show abnormal amyloplast 
      distribution and reduced gravitropism at 1 g. We found that the correlation between 
      hypergravity-induced amyloplast sedimentation and gravitropic curvature of these 
      mutants was identical to that of wild-type plants. These observations suggest that 
      Arabidopsis shoots have a gravisensing mechanism that linearly converts the number 
      of amyloplasts that settle to the 'bottom' of the cell into gravitropic signals. 
      Further, the restoration of the gravitropic response by hypergravity in the 
      gravitropic mutants that we tested indicates that these lines probably have a 
      functional gravisensing mechanism that is not triggered at 1 g.

TI  - Analysis of the Velocity Distribution in Partially-Filled Circular Pipe Employing 
      the Principle of Maximum Entropy.
PG  - e0151578
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0151578 [doi]
LID - e0151578
AB  - The flow velocity distribution in partially-filled circular pipe was investigated in 
      this paper. The velocity profile is different from full-filled pipe flow, since the 
      flow is driven by gravity, not by pressure. The research findings show that the 
      position of maximum flow is below the water surface, and varies with the water 
      depth. In the region of near tube wall, the fluid velocity is mainly influenced by 
      the friction of the wall and the pipe bottom slope, and the variation of velocity is 
      similar to full-filled pipe. But near the free water surface, the velocity 
      distribution is mainly affected by the contractive tube wall and the secondary flow, 
      and the variation of the velocity is relatively small. Literature retrieval results 
      show relatively less research has been shown on the practical expression to describe 
      the velocity distribution of partially-filled circular pipe. An expression of 
      two-dimensional (2D) velocity distribution in partially-filled circular pipe flow 
      was derived based on the principle of maximum entropy (POME). Different entropies 
      were compared according to fluid knowledge, and non-extensive entropy was chosen. A 
      new cumulative distribution function (CDF) of partially-filled circular pipe 
      velocity in terms of flow depth was hypothesized. Combined with the CDF hypothesis, 
      the 2D velocity distribution was derived, and the position of maximum velocity 
      distribution was analyzed. The experimental results show that the estimated velocity 
      values based on the principle of maximum Tsallis wavelet entropy are in good 
      agreement with measured values.

      Here we developed a microfluidic device with contiguous media-filled compartments 
      that uses gravity-driven flow to generate a stable and highly reproducible gradient 
      within a viewing compartment only accessible to axons. This device uses 
      high-resistance microgrooves to both direct the growth of axons into an isolated 
      region and to generate a stable gradient within the fluidically isolated axon 
      viewing compartment for over 22 h. Establishing a stable gradient relies on a simple 
      and quick pipetting procedure with no external pump or tubing. Since the axons 
      extend into the axonal compartment through aligned microgrooves, the analysis of 
      turning is simplified. Further, the multiple microgrooves in parallel alignment 
      serve to increase sample sizes, improving statistical analyses. We used this method 
      to examine growth cone turning in response to the secreted axon guidance cue 
      netrin-1. We report the novel finding that growth cones of embryonic mouse cortical 
      axons exhibited attractive turning in the lower concentrations of netrin-1, but were 
      repulsed when exposed to higher concentrations. We also performed 
      immunocytochemistry in growth cones exposed to a netrin-1 gradient within the axon 
      viewing compartment and show that netrin receptors associated with both attraction 
      and repulsion, DCC and UNC5H, localized to these growth cones. Together, we 
      developed an accessible gradient chamber for higher throughput axon guidance studies 
      and demonstrated its capabilities.

TI  - Temporally heterogeneous dynamics in granular flows.
PG  - 098002
AB  - Granular simulations are used to probe the particle scale dynamics at short, 
      intermediate, and long time scales for gravity-driven, dense granular flows down an 
      inclined plane. On approach to the angle of repose, where motion ceases, the 
      dynamics become intermittent over intermediate times, with strong temporal 
      correlations between particle motions-temporally heterogeneous dynamics. This 
      intermittency is characterized through large-scale structural events whereby the 
      contact network periodically spans the system. A characteristic time scale 
      associated with these processes increases as the stopped state is approached. These 
      features are discussed in the context of the dynamics of supercooled liquids near 
      the glass transition.

TI  - Statolith sedimentation kinetics and force transduction to the cortical endoplasmic 
      reticulum in gravity-sensing Arabidopsis columella cells.
PG  - 843-60
LID - 10.1105/tpc.108.065052 [doi]
AB  - The starch statolith hypothesis of gravity sensing in plants postulates that the 
      sedimentation of statoliths in specialized statocytes (columella cells) provides the 
      means for converting the gravitational potential energy into a biochemical signal. 
      We have analyzed the sedimentation kinetics of statoliths in the central S2 
      columella cells of Arabidopsis thaliana. The statoliths can form compact aggregates 
      with gap sizes between statoliths approaching <30 nm. Significant intra-aggregate 
      sliding motions of individual statoliths suggest a contribution of hydrodynamic 
      forces to the motion of statoliths. The reorientation of the columella cells 
      accelerates the statoliths toward the central cytoplasm within <1 s of 
      reorientation. During the subsequent sedimentation phase, the statoliths tend to 
      move at a distance to the cortical endoplasmic reticulum (ER) boundary and interact 
      only transiently with the ER. Statoliths moved by laser tweezers against the ER 
      boundary experience an elastic lift force upon release from the optical trap. 
      High-resolution electron tomography analysis of statolith-to-ER contact sites 
      indicate that the weight of statoliths is sufficient to locally deform the ER 
      membranes that can potentially activate mechanosensitive ion channels. We suggest 
      that in root columella cells, the transduction of the kinetic energy of sedimenting 
      statoliths into a biochemical signal involves a combination of statolith-driven 
      motion of the cytosol, statolith-induced deformation of the ER membranes, and a 
      rapid release of kinetic energy from the ER during reorientation to activate 
      mechanosensitive sites within the central columella cells.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the feasibility of safely performing aqueous angiography in 
      intact eyes of living nonhuman primates (NHPs) for evaluating aqueous humor outflow 
      and segmental patterns. DESIGN: Cross-sectional, observational study. SUBJECTS: Six 
      nonhuman primates. METHODS: Aqueous angiography was performed in 6 nonhuman 
      primates. After anesthesia, an anterior chamber (AC) maintainer was placed through a 
      temporal 1-mm side-port wound. Indocyanine green (ICG; 0.4%) or 2.5% fluorescein was 
      introduced (individually or in sequence) into the eye with a gravity-driven 
      constant-pressure system. Aqueous angiography images were obtained with a Spectralis 
      HRA+OCT (Heidelberg Engineering GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) suspended over the NHP 
      eye using a custom-designed surgical boom arm. Concurrent anterior segment optical 
      coherence tomography (OCT) was performed on distally angiographically positive and 
      negative regions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Angiographic patterns described by 
      location, time-course, choice of tracer, and anterior-segment OCT. RESULTS: Aqueous 
      angiography in the living NHP eye demonstrated mostly stable angiographic patterns. 
      With multimodal imaging, angiographically positive signal co-localized with 
      episcleral veins as identified by infrared imaging and intrascleral lumens, as 
      demonstrated by anterior segment OCT. Sequential aqueous angiography in individual 
      eyes with ICG followed by fluorescein showed similar angiographic patterns. A 
      pulsatile nature of aqueous angiographic outflow was sometimes observed. Aqueous 
      angiographic patterns could also dynamically change. In some instances, positive 
      angiographic flow suddenly arose in regions previously without an angiographic 
      signal. Alternatively, an angiographic signal could suddenly disappear from regions 
      in which an angiographic signal was initially documented. CONCLUSIONS: Aqueous 
      angiography in living NHPs demonstrated segmental and pulsatile patterns with a 
      newly described ability to dynamically shift. These characteristics further the 
      understanding of live aqueous humor outflow biology and may be useful in improving 
      glaucoma surgeries aimed at trabecular meshwork bypass.

AB  - Bacteria grown in space experiments under microgravity conditions have been found to 
      undergo unique physiological responses, ranging from modified cell morphology and 
      growth dynamics to a putative increased tolerance to antibiotics. A common theory 
      for this behavior is the loss of gravity-driven convection processes in the orbital 
      environment, resulting in both reduction of extracellular nutrient availability and 
      the accumulation of bacterial byproducts near the cell. To further characterize the 
      responses, this study investigated the transcriptomic response of Escherichia coli 
      to both microgravity and antibiotic concentration. E. coli was grown aboard 
      International Space Station in the presence of increasing concentrations of the 
      antibiotic gentamicin with identical ground controls conducted on Earth. Here we 
      show that within 49 h of being cultured, E. coli adapted to grow at higher 
      antibiotic concentrations in space compared to Earth, and demonstrated consistent 
      changes in expression of 63 genes in response to an increase in drug concentration 
      in both environments, including specific responses related to oxidative stress and 
      starvation response. Additionally, we find 50 stress-response genes upregulated in 
      response to the microgravity when compared directly to the equivalent concentration 
      in the ground control. We conclude that the increased antibiotic tolerance in 
      microgravity may be attributed not only to diminished transport processes, but also 
      to a resultant antibiotic cross-resistance response conferred by an overlapping 
      effect of stress response genes. Our data suggest that direct stresses of nutrient 
      starvation and acid-shock conveyed by the microgravity environment can incidentally 
      upregulate stress response pathways related to antibiotic stress and in doing so 
      contribute to the increased antibiotic stress tolerance observed for bacteria in 
      space experiments. These results provide insights into the ability of bacteria to 
      adapt under extreme stress conditions and potential strategies to prevent 
      antimicrobial-resistance in space and on Earth.

AB  - On-site biological hand washing water treatment can improve global access to safe 
      hand washing water, but requires a thorough understanding of the chemical 
      composition of the water to be treated, and an effective treatment strategy. This 
      study first presents a detailed characterization of the individual inputs to hand 
      washing water. We demonstrate (i) that soap is likely the most significant input in 
      hand washing water, representing ∼90% of mass loading, and (ii) that inputs to hand 
      washing water have low concentrations of biologically-essential macro- and 
      micro-nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, copper, zinc, molybdenum and 
      cobalt) with respect to carbon, which may impair biological carbon removal. This 
      study next formulates a recipe that recreates a representative composition of hand 
      washing water and develops a procedure to identify and supplement nutrients in which 
      this recipe is estimated to be deficient. Batch testing of the nutrient-supplemented 
      hand washing water with an inoculum of planktonic bacteria demonstrated improved 
      assimilable organic carbon removal (99% vs. 86% removal) and produced lower final 
      dissolved organic carbon concentrations (1.7 mg(C)/L vs. 3.5 mg(C)/L) compared to 
      realistic (nutrient-deficient) washing water. Supplementing nutrients did promote 
      cell growth (50x higher final total cell count). Full-scale testing in a 
      biologically activated membrane bioreactor (BAMBi) system treating 75 L/day of 
      nutrient-supplemented hand washing water showed that long-term operation (100 days) 
      can deliver effective carbon removal (95%) without detrimental fouling or other 
      disruptions caused by cell growth. This work demonstrates that biological treatment 
      in a BAMBi system, operated with appropriate nutrient-balancing offers an effective 
      solution for decentralized treatment of light greywater.

TI  - In Situ Remodeling Overrules Bioinspired Scaffold Architecture of Supramolecular 
      Elastomeric Tissue-Engineered Heart Valves.

AB  - In situ tissue engineering that uses resorbable synthetic heart valve scaffolds is 
      an affordable and practical approach for heart valve replacement; therefore, it is 
      attractive for clinical use. This study showed no consistent collagen organization 
      in the predefined direction of electrospun scaffolds made from a resorbable 
      supramolecular elastomer with random or circumferentially aligned fibers, after 
      12 months of implantation in sheep. These unexpected findings and the observed 
      intervalvular variability highlight the need for a mechanistic understanding of the 
      long-term in situ remodeling processes in large animal models to improve 
      predictability of outcome toward robust and safe clinical application.

AB  - Mass transport within collagen-based matrices is critical to tissue development, 
      repair, and pathogenesis, as well as the design of next-generation tissue 
      engineering strategies. This work shows how collagen precursors, specified by 
      intermolecular cross-link composition, provide independent control of collagen 
      matrix mechanical and transport properties. Collagen matrices were prepared from 
      tissue-extracted monomers or oligomers. Viscoelastic behavior was measured in 
      oscillatory shear and unconfined compression. Matrix permeability and diffusivity 
      were measured using gravity-driven permeametry and integrated optical imaging, 
      respectively. Both collagen types showed an increase in stiffness and permeability 
      hindrance with increasing collagen concentration (fibril density); however, 
      different physical property–concentration relationships were noted. Diffusivity was 
      not affected by concentration for either collagen type over the range tested. In 
      general, oligomer matrices exhibited a substantial increase in stiffness and only a 
      modest decrease in transport properties when compared with monomer matrices prepared 
      at the same concentration. The observed differences in viscoelastic and transport 
      properties were largely attributed to increased levels of interfibril branching 
      within oligomer matrices. The ability to relate physical properties to relevant 
      microstructure parameters, including fibril density and interfibril branching, is 
      expected to advance the understanding of cell–matrix signaling, as well as 
      facilitate model-based prediction and design of matrix-based therapeutic strategies.

AB  - The study of vesicles in suspension is important to understand the complicated 
      dynamics exhibited by cells in in vivo and in vitro. We developed a computer 
      simulation based on the boundary-integral method to model the three dimensional 
      gravity-driven sedimentation of charged vesicles towards a flat surface. The 
      membrane mechanical behavior was modeled using the Helfrich Hamiltonian and near 
      incompressibility of the membrane was enforced via a model which accounts for the 
      thermal fluctuations of the membrane. The simulations were verified and compared to 
      experimental data obtained using suspended vesicles labelled with a fluorescent 
      probe, which allows visualization using fluorescence microscopy and confers the 
      membrane with a negative surface charge. The electrostatic interaction between the 
      vesicle and the surface was modeled using the linear Derjaguin approximation for a 
      low ionic concentration solution. The sedimentation rate as a function of the 
      distance of the vesicle to the surface was determined both experimentally and from 
      the computer simulations. The gap between the vesicle and the surface, as well as 
      the shape of the vesicle at equilibrium were also studied. It was determined that 
      inclusion of the electrostatic interaction is fundamental to accurately predict the 
      sedimentation rate as the vesicle approaches the surface and the size of the gap at 
      equilibrium, we also observed that the presence of charge in the membrane increases 
      its rigidity.

AB  - Baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) has broad genetic homology to human cells. 
      Although typically grown as 1-2mm diameter colonies under certain conditions yeast 
      can form very large (10 + mm in diameter) or 'giant' colonies on agar. Giant yeast 
      colonies have been used to study diverse biomedical processes such as cell survival, 
      aging, and the response to cancer pharmacogenomics. Such colonies evolve dynamically 
      into complex stratified structures that respond differentially to environmental 
      cues. Ammonia production, gravity driven ammonia convection, and shear defense 
      responses are key differentiation signals for cell death and reactive oxygen system 
      pathways in these colonies. The response to these signals can be modulated by 
      experimental interventions such as agar composition, gene deletion and application 
      of pharmaceuticals. In this study we used physical factors including colony rotation 
      and microgravity to modify ammonia convection and shear stress as environmental cues 
      and observed differences in the responses of both ammonia dependent and stress 
      response dependent pathways We found that the effects of random positioning are 
      distinct from rotation. Furthermore, both true and simulated microgravity 
      exacerbated both cellular redox responses and apoptosis. These changes were largely 
      shear-response dependent but each model had a unique response signature as measured 
      by shear stress genes and the promoter set which regulates them These physical 
      techniques permitted a graded manipulation of both convection and ammonia signaling 
      and are primed to substantially contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms of 
      drug action, cell aging, and colony differentiation.

AB  - Oxidative stress (OS) is an important consequence of exposure to toxic metals but it 
      is unclear to what extent low-level metal exposures contribute to OS in children. We 
      examined the cross-sectional association between urinary concentrations of arsenic 
      (As), cadmium (Cd), and lead (Pb) and urinary markers of OS: F(2)-8α isoprostane and 
      8-hydroxy-2-deoxy-guanosine (8-OHdG). We also tested effect modification by dietary 
      intakes. Of the 211 children aged 6-8 years living in Montevideo who were eligible 
      for the study because they had at least one OS marker measured via ELISA, 143 were 
      included in a complete-case analysis. Urinary metals were measured with inductively 
      coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS: Pb, Cd) and high-performance liquid 
      chromatography online with hydride generation ICP-MS (As-metabolites); 
      concentrations were log(2)-transformed. All urinary markers were adjusted for 
      specific gravity of urine. Two 24-h dietary recalls were conducted to estimate 
      children's dietary intakes, including total fruit and vegetable consumption and 
      vitamin C, zinc and fiber intake. Ordinary least square (OLS) and weighted quantile 
      sum (WQS) regressions were used to estimate the association between metals and each 
      OS marker as outcome. Metal exposure was generally low: median urinary As, Cd, Pb 
      9.6 μg/L, 0.06 μg/L and 1.9 μg/L, respectively. Median 8-isoprostane concentration 
      was 1.1 and 8-OHdG 39.6 ng/mL. Log(2)-transformed urinary As concentrations were 
      positively associated with 8-OHdG concentrations (10.90 [3.82, 17.97]) in 
      covariate-adjusted OLS models which also took account of exposure to Cd and Pb. In 
      WQS, a mixture index was also associated with higher 8-OHdG (8.71 [1.12, 16.3] for 
      each 25% increase in index value), mostly driven by As exposure. There was little 
      evidence of effect modification by dietary antioxidants. In sum, even at low-level, 
      As exposure is associated with detectable oxidative damage to the DNA.

AB  - Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) observations provide information on 
      Total Water Storage Anomaly (TWSA) which is a key variable for drought monitoring 
      and assessment. The so-called Total Water Storage Deficit Index (TWSDI) based on 
      GRACE data has been widely used for characterizing drought events. Here we show that 
      the commonly used TWSDI approach often exhibits significant inconsistencies with 
      meteorological conditions, primarily upon presence of a trend in observations due to 
      anthropogenic water use. In this study, we propose a modified version of TWSDI 
      (termed, MTWSDI) that decomposes the anthropogenic and climatic-driven components of 
      GRACE observations. We applied our approach for drought monitoring over the 
      Ganges-Brahmaputra in India and Markazi basins in Iran. Results show that the newly 
      developed MTWSDI exhibits consistency with meteorological drought indices in both 
      basins. We also propose a deficit-based method for drought monitoring and recovery 
      assessment using GRACE observations, providing useful information about volume of 
      deficit, and minimum and average time for drought recovery. According to the deficit 
      thresholds, water deficits caused by anthropogenic impacts every year in the 
      Ganges-Brahmaputra basin and Markazi basins is almost equal to an abnormally dry 
      condition and a moderate drought condition, receptively. It indicates that 
      unsustainable human water use have led to a form of perpetual and accelerated 
      anthropogenic drought in these basins. Continuation of this trend would deplete the 
      basin and cause significant socio-economic challenges.

AB  - Shaped colloids can be used as nanoscale building blocks for the construction of 
      composite, functional materials that are completely assembled from the bottom up. 
      Assemblies of noble metal nanostructures have unique optical properties that depend 
      on key structural features requiring precise control of both position and 
      connectivity spanning nanometer to micrometer length scales. Identifying and 
      optimizing structures that strongly couple to light is important for understanding 
      the behavior of surface plasmons in small nanoparticle clusters, and can result in 
      highly sensitive chemical and biochemical sensors using surface-enhanced Raman 
      spectroscopy (SERS). We use experiment and simulation to examine the local surface 
      plasmon resonances of different arrangements of Ag polyhedral clusters. 
      High-resolution transmission electron microscopy shows that monodisperse, atomically 
      smooth Ag polyhedra can self-assemble into uniform interparticle gaps that result in 
      reproducible SERS enhancement factors from assembly to assembly. We introduce a 
      large-scale, gravity-driven assembly method that can generate arbitrary nanoparticle 
      clusters based on the size and shape of a patterned template. These templates enable 
      the systematic examination of different cluster arrangements and provide a means of 
      constructing scalable and reliable SERS sensors.

AB  - Various space missions have measured the total solar irradiance (TSI) since 1978. 
      Among them the experiments Precision Monitoring of Solar Variability (PREMOS) on the 
      PICARD satellite (2010-2014) and the Variability of Irradiance and Gravity 
      Oscillations (VIRGO) on the mission Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, which 
      started in 1996 and is still operational. Like most TSI experiments, they employ a 
      dual-channel approach with different exposure rates to track and correct the 
      inevitable degradation of their radiometers. Until now, the process of degradation 
      correction has been mostly a manual process based on assumed knowledge of the sensor 
      hardware. Here we present a new data-driven process to assess and correct instrument 
      degradation using a machine-learning and data fusion algorithm, that does not 
      require deep knowledge of the sensor hardware. We apply the algorithm to the TSI 
      records of PREMOS and VIRGO and compare the results to the previously published 
      results. The data fusion part of the algorithm can also be used to combine data from 
      different instruments and missions into a composite time series. Based on the fusion 
      of the degradation-corrected VIRGO/PMO6 and VIRGO/DIARAD time series, we find no 
      significant change (i.e [Formula: see text] W/m[Formula: see text]) between the TSI 
      levels during the two most recent solar minima in 2008/09 and 2019/20. The new 
      algorithm can be applied to any TSI experiment that employs a multi-channel 
      philosophy for degradation tracking. It does not require deep technical knowledge of 
      the individual radiometers.

AB  - Predominantly closed-cell low density shape memory polymer (SMP) foam was recently 
      reported to be an effective aneurysm filling device in a porcine model (Rodriguez et 
      al., Journal of Biomedical Materials Research Part A 2013: 
      (http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jbm.a.34782)). Because healing involves blood clotting 
      and cell migration throughout the foam volume, a more open-cell structure may 
      further enhance the healing response. This research sought to develop a 
      non-destructive reticulation process for this SMP foam to disrupt the membranes 
      between pore cells. Non-destructive mechanical reticulation was achieved using a 
      gravity-driven floating nitinol pin array coupled with vibratory agitation of the 
      foam and supplemental chemical etching. Reticulation resulted in a reduced elastic 
      modulus and increased permeability, but did not impede the shape memory behavior. 
      Reticulated foams were capable of achieving rapid vascular occlusion in an in vivo 
      porcine model.

AB  - Large-area micropore arrays with a high porosity are in high demand because of their 
      promising potential in liquid biopsy with a large volume of clinical sample. 
      However, a micropore array with a large area and a high porosity faces a serious 
      mechanical strength challenge. The filtration membrane may undergo large deformation 
      at a high filtration throughput, which will decrease its size separation accuracy. 
      In this work, a keyhole-free Parylene molding process has been developed to prepare 
      a large (>20 mm × 20 mm) filtration membrane containing a 2.5-dimensional (2.5D) 
      micropore array with an ultra-high porosity (up to 91.37% with designed pore 
      diameter/space of 100 μm/4 μm). The notation 2.5D indicates that the large area and 
      the relatively small thickness (approximately 10 μm) of the fabricated membranes 
      represent 2D properties, while the large thickness-to-width ratio (10 μm/ < 4 μm) of 
      the spaces between the adjacent pores corresponds to a local 3D feature. The large 
      area and high porosity of the micropore array achieved filtration with a throughput 
      up to 180 mL/min (PBS solution) simply driven by gravity. Meanwhile, the high 
      mechanical strength, benefiting from the 2.5D structure of the micropore array, 
      ensured a negligible pore size variation during the high-throughput filtration, 
      thereby enabling high size resolution separation, which was proven by single-layer 
      and multi-layer filtrations for particle separation. Furthermore, as a preliminary 
      demonstration, the prepared 2.5-dimensional Parylene C micropore array was 
      implemented as an efficient filter for rare cancer cell separation from a large 
      volume, approximately 10 cells in 10 mL PBS and undiluted urine, with high recovery 
      rates of 87 ± 13% and 56 ± 13%, respectively.

AB  - A variety of methods have been used to introduce chemicals into a stream or to mix 
      two or more streams of different compositions using microfluidic devices. In the 
      following paper, the introduction of cryoprotective agents (CPAs) used during 
      cryopreservation of cells in order to protect them from freezing injuries and 
      increase viability post thaw is described. Dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) is the most 
      commonly used CPA. We aim to optimize the operating conditions of a two-stream 
      microfluidic device to introduce a 10% vol/vol solution of DMSO into a cell 
      suspension. Transport behavior of DMSO between two streams in the device has been 
      experimentally characterized for a spectrum of flow conditions (0.7 < Re < 10), 
      varying initial donor stream concentrations, (1% vol/vol < C o  < 15% vol/vol) and 
      different flow rate fractions (0.23 < f q  < 0.77). The outlet cell stream 
      concentration is analyzed for two different flow configurations: one with the cell 
      stream flowing on top of the DMSO-rich donor stream, and the other with the cell 
      stream flowing beneath the heavy DMSO-laden stream. We establish a transition from a 
      diffusive mode of mass transfer to gravity-influenced convective currents for Atwood 
      numbers (A t ) in the range of (1.7 × 10(-3) < A t  < 3.1 × 10(-3)) for the latter 
      configuration. Flow visualization with cells further our understanding of the effect 
      of A t on the nature of mass transport. Cell motion studies performed with Jurkat 
      cells confirm a high cell recovery from the device while underscoring the need to 
      collect both the streams at the outlet of the device and suggesting flow conditions 
      that will help us achieve the target DMSO outlet concentration for clinical scale 
      flow rates of the cell suspension.

TI  - Repeated measurement of Mo(2) in small aquatic organisms: a manual intermittent flow 
      respirometer using off-the-shelf components.
PG  - 741-749
LID - 10.1152/japplphysiol.00771.2017 [doi]
AB  - Measurement of rates of oxygen consumption ( Mo(2)) in small aquatic embryos or 
      larvae (<1 mm) in response to altered environmental conditions has traditionally 
      been challenging. Here, using modifications of a commercially available fluorescent 
      optode flow-through cell (FTC; PreSens FTC-PSt3) and routine laboratory supplies 
      (syringes, stopcocks, tubing), we have constructed a manual intermittent flow 
      respirometer (MIFR) that allows measurement of Mo(2) in small numbers of individuals 
      when sequentially exposed to different environmental conditions (e.g., changes in 
      seawater pH) through a gravity-driven media replacement perfusion system. We first 
      show that the FTC can be used in "static" mode while incubating small numbers of 
      embryos/larvae contained within the planar oxygen sensor (POS) chamber with Nitex 
      filters. We then demonstrate the use of the MIFR by exposing larval echinoderms ( 
      Fellaster zelandiae, Evechinus chloroticus, and Centrostephanus rodgersii) to 
      seawater equilibrated with elevated CO(2) and measured Mo(2) during acute and 
      chronic exposure to hypercapnia. This MIFR method will allow investigators to 
      address questions regarding the respiratory physiology of small aquatic animals, 
      such as the thresholds for metabolic depression in embryonic and larval forms. NEW & 
      NOTEWORTHY A manual intermittent flow respirometer (MIFR), allowing media exchange 
      in a flow-through cell containing small aquatic organisms, permits repeated 
      measurement of Mo(2) of individuals not only in a single medium (e.g., technical 
      replication), but also in different media (here, high CO(2)-equilibrated seawater), 
      enabling measurement of acute physiological responses to changed conditions. This 
      versatile technique has wide-ranging implications for the study of the Mo(2) 
      response of aquatic organisms in the face of climate change.

TI  - Effect of Body Position on Pharyngeal Swallowing Pressures Using High-Resolution 
      Manometry.
PG  - 389-398
LID - 10.1007/s00455-017-9866-3 [doi]
AB  - The effect of body position and gravitational pull on the complex pressure-driven 
      process of pharyngeal swallowing remains unknown. Using high-resolution manometry 
      (HRM), this study aims to identify positional adaptations of pharyngeal physiology 
      by evaluating swallowing pressure patterns in a series of inverted body positions. 
      Ten healthy adults each underwent swallowing tasks with pharyngeal HRM at six body 
      positions using an inversion table (0°[upright], 45°, 90°[supine], 110°, 135°, and 
      180°[fully inverted]). Repeated measures ANOVA was used to assess impact of position 
      on pressure parameters, and pharyngeal-UES pressure gradients translate. 
      Velopharyngeal pressures varied by position (P < 0.001), with significantly higher 
      pressures generated with inversion ≥90°, compared with upright and 45°. Change in 
      position did not significantly affect common mesopharyngeal pressures or swallowing 
      pressure durations. UES valving mechanisms were preserved during inversion, with 
      subtle variations observed in integral pressures (P = 0.011). Pharyngeal-UES 
      pressure gradients changed with position (P < 0.01), increasing with inversion > 90° 
      compared to upright and 45°. Mechanisms of deglutition may differ with position and 
      relative direction of gravity, particularly when at > 45° inclination. Increased 
      palatal pressure is generated in the upside-down position to achieve nasopharyngeal 
      closure and prevent regurgitation. While other classically measured pressures may 
      not consistently differ with positioning, many individuals exhibit adaptations in 
      pressure gradients when inverted, likely due to a combination of changes in 
      pharyngeal driving force and UES opening mechanisms. Identification of these 
      changes, relative to position, further builds on our understanding of the 
      adaptability of the pharyngeal swallowing system.

TI  - Use of Principal Components for Scaling Up Topographic Models to Map Soil 
      Redistribution and Soil Organic Carbon.
LID - 10.3791/58189 [doi]
LID - 58189
AB  - Landscape topography is a critical factor affecting soil formation and plays an 
      important role in determining soil properties on the earth surface, as it regulates 
      the gravity-driven soil movement induced by runoff and tillage activities. The 
      recent application of Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data holds promise for 
      generating high spatial resolution topographic metrics that can be used to 
      investigate soil property variability. In this study, fifteen topographic metrics 
      derived from LiDAR data were used to investigate topographic impacts on 
      redistribution of soil and spatial distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC). 
      Specifically, we explored the use of topographic principal components (TPCs) for 
      characterizing topography metrics and stepwise principal component regression (SPCR) 
      to develop topography-based soil erosion and SOC models at site and watershed 
      scales. Performance of SPCR models was evaluated against stepwise ordinary least 
      square regression (SOLSR) models. Results showed that SPCR models outperformed SOLSR 
      models in predicting soil redistribution rates and SOC density at different spatial 
      scales. Use of TPCs removes potential collinearity between individual input 
      variables, and dimensionality reduction by principal component analysis (PCA) 
      diminishes the risk of overfitting the prediction models. This study proposes a new 
      approach for modeling soil redistribution across various spatial scales. For one 
      application, access to private lands is often limited, and the need to extrapolate 
      findings from representative study sites to larger settings that include private 
      lands can be important.

TI  - Forecasting Effusive Dynamics and Decompression Rates by Magmastatic Model at 
      Open-vent Volcanoes.
PG  - 3885
LID - 10.1038/s41598-017-03833-3 [doi]
LID - 3885
AB  - Effusive eruptions at open-conduit volcanoes are interpreted as reactions to a 
      disequilibrium induced by the increase in magma supply. By comparing four of the 
      most recent effusive eruptions at Stromboli volcano (Italy), we show how the volumes 
      of lava discharged during each eruption are linearly correlated to the topographic 
      positions of the effusive vents. This correlation cannot be explained by an excess 
      of pressure within a deep magma chamber and raises questions about the actual 
      contributions of deep magma dynamics. We derive a general model based on the 
      discharge of a shallow reservoir and the magmastatic crustal load above the vent, to 
      explain the linear link. In addition, we show how the drastic transition from 
      effusive to violent explosions can be related to different decompression rates. We 
      suggest that a gravity-driven model can shed light on similar cases of lateral 
      effusive eruptions in other volcanic systems and can provide evidence of the roles 
      of slow decompression rates in triggering violent paroxysmal explosive eruptions, 
      which occasionally punctuate the effusive phases at basaltic volcanoes.

TI  - Accelerating changes in ice mass within Greenland, and the ice sheet's sensitivity 
      to atmospheric forcing.
PG  - 1934-1939

AB  - From early 2003 to mid-2013, the total mass of ice in Greenland declined at a 
      progressively increasing rate. In mid-2013, an abrupt reversal occurred, and very 
      little net ice loss occurred in the next 12-18 months. Gravity Recovery and Climate 
      Experiment (GRACE) and global positioning system (GPS) observations reveal that the 
      spatial patterns of the sustained acceleration and the abrupt deceleration in mass 
      loss are similar. The strongest accelerations tracked the phase of the North 
      Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The negative phase of the NAO enhances summertime 
      warming and insolation while reducing snowfall, especially in west Greenland, 
      driving surface mass balance (SMB) more negative, as illustrated using the regional 
      climate model MAR. The spatial pattern of accelerating mass changes reflects the 
      geography of NAO-driven shifts in atmospheric forcing and the ice sheet's 
      sensitivity to that forcing. We infer that southwest Greenland will become a major 
      future contributor to sea level rise.

TI  - Accounting for intraoperative brain shift ascribable to cavity collapse during 
      intracranial tumor resection.
PG  - 031506

AB  - Purpose: For many patients with intracranial tumors, accurate surgical resection is 
      a mainstay of their treatment paradigm. During surgical resection, image guidance is 
      used to aid in localization and resection. Intraoperative brain shift can invalidate 
      these guidance systems. One cause of intraoperative brain shift is cavity collapse 
      due to tumor resection, which will be referred to as "debulking." We developed an 
      imaging-driven finite element model of debulking to create a comprehensive 
      simulation data set to reflect possible intraoperative changes. The objective was to 
      create a method to account for brain shift due to debulking for applications in 
      image-guided neurosurgery. We hypothesized that accounting for tumor debulking in a 
      deformation atlas data framework would improve brain shift predictions, which would 
      enhance image-based surgical guidance. Approach: This was evaluated in a six-patient 
      intracranial tumor resection intraoperative data set. The brain shift deformation 
      atlas data framework consisted of n = 756 simulated deformations to account for 
      effects due to gravity-induced and hyperosmotic drug-induced brain shift, which 
      reflects previous developments. An additional complement of n = 84 deformations 
      involving simulated tumor growth followed by debulking was created to capture 
      observed intraoperative effects not previously included. Results: In five of six 
      patient cases evaluated, inclusion of debulking mechanics improved brain shift 
      correction by capturing global mass effects resulting from the resected tumor. 
      Conclusions: These findings suggest imaging-driven brain shift models used to create 
      a deformation simulation data framework of observed intraoperative events can be 
      used to assist in more accurate image-guided surgical navigation in the brain.

TI  - Regularity criterion for solutions of the three-dimensional 
      Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes equations and associated computations.
PG  - 063103
LID - 10.1103/PhysRevE.94.063103 [doi]
AB  - We consider the three-dimensional (3D) Cahn-Hilliard equations coupled to, and 
      driven by, the forced, incompressible 3D Navier-Stokes equations. The combination, 
      known as the Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (CHNS) equations, is used in statistical 
      mechanics to model the motion of a binary fluid. The potential development of 
      singularities (blow-up) in the contours of the order parameter ϕ is an open problem. 
      To address this we have proved a theorem that closely mimics the Beale-Kato-Majda 
      theorem for the 3D incompressible Euler equations [J. T. Beale, T. Kato, and A. J. 
      Majda, Commun. Math. Phys. 94, 61 (1984)CMPHAY0010-361610.1007/BF01212349]. By 
      taking an L^{∞} norm of the energy of the full binary system, designated as E_{∞}, 
      we have shown that ∫_{0}^{t}E_{∞}(τ)dτ governs the regularity of solutions of the 
      full 3D system. Our direct numerical simulations (DNSs) of the 3D CHNS equations for 
      (a) a gravity-driven Rayleigh Taylor instability and (b) a constant-energy-injection 
      forcing, with 128^{3} to 512^{3} collocation points and over the duration of our 
      DNSs confirm that E_{∞} remains bounded as far as our computations allow.

PG  - 207-10
LID - 10.1016/S0079-6123(08)00628-6 [doi]
AB  - To investigate the contribution of the vestibular velocity-storage mechanism (VSM) 
      to the vertical rotational vestibulo-ocular reflex (rVOR) we recorded eye movements 
      evoked by off-vertical axis rotation (OVAR) using whole-body constant-velocity pitch 
      rotations about an earth-horizontal, interaural axis in four healthy human subjects. 
      Subjects were tumbled forward, and backward, at 60 deg/s for over 1 min using a 3D 
      turntable. Slow-phase velocity (SPV) responses were similar to the horizontal 
      responses elicited by OVAR along the body longitudinal axis, ('barbecue' rotation), 
      with exponentially decaying amplitudes and a residual, otolith-driven sinusoidal 
      response with a bias. The time constants of the vertical SPV ranged from 6 to 9 s. 
      These values are closer to those that reflect the dynamic properties of vestibular 
      afferents than the typical 20 s produced by the VSM in the horizontal plane, 
      confirming the relatively smaller contribution of the VSM to these vertical 
      responses. Our preliminary results also agree with the idea that the VSM velocity 
      response aligns with the direction of gravity. The horizontal and torsional eye 
      velocity traces were also sinusoidally modulated by the change in gravity, but 
      showed no exponential decay.

TI  - Online corrective responses following target jump in altered gravitoinertial force 
      field point to nested feedforward and feedback control.
PG  - 154-165
LID - 10.1152/jn.00268.2020 [doi]
AB  - Studies on goal-directed arm movements have shown a close link between feedforward 
      and feedback control in protocols where both planning and online control processes 
      faced a similar type of perturbation, either mechanical or visual. This particular 
      context might have facilitated the use of an adapted internal model by feedforward 
      and feedback control. Here, we considered this link in a context where, after 
      feedforward control was adapted through proprioception-based processes, feedback 
      control was tested under visual perturbation. We analyzed the response of the 
      reaching hand to target displacements following adaptation to an altered force field 
      induced by rotating participants at constant velocity. Reaching corrections were 
      assessed through variables related to the accuracy (lateral and longitudinal end 
      point errors) and kinematics (movement time, peak velocity) of the corrective 
      movements. The electromyographic activity of different arm muscles (pectoralis, 
      posterior deltoid, biceps brachii, and triceps brachii) was analyzed. Statistical 
      analyses revealed that accuracy and kinematics of corrective movements were 
      strikingly alike between normal and altered gravitoinertial force fields. However, 
      pectoralis and biceps muscle activities recorded during corrective movements were 
      significantly modified to counteract the effect of rotation-induced Coriolis and 
      centrifugal forces on the arm. Remarkably, feedback control was functional from the 
      very first time participants encountered a target jump in the altered force field. 
      Overall, the present results demonstrate that feedforward control enables immediate 
      functional feedback control even when applied to distinct sensorimotor processes.NEW 
      & NOTEWORTHY We investigated the link between feedforward and feedback control when 
      applying a double-step perturbation (visual target jump) during reaching movements 
      performed in modified gravitoinertial environments. Altogether, kinematics and EMG 
      analyses showed that movement corrections were highly effective in the different 
      force fields, suggesting that, although feedforward and feedback control were driven 
      by different sensory inputs, feedback control was remarkably functional from the 
      very first time participants encountered a target jump in the altered force field.

TI  - Pattern Evolution during Double Liquid-Vapor Phase Transitions under Weightlessness.
LID - 10.3390/molecules22060947 [doi]
LID - 947
AB  - Phase transition in fluids is ubiquitous in nature and has important applications in 
      areas such as the food industry for volatile oils' extraction or in nuclear plants 
      for heat transfer. Fundamentals are hampered by gravity effects on Earth. We used 
      direct imaging to record snapshots of phase separation that takes place in sulfur 
      hexafluoride, SF₆, under weightlessness conditions on the International Space 
      Station (ISS). The system was already at liquid-vapor equilibrium slightly below the 
      critical temperature and further cooled down by a 0.2-mK temperature quench that 
      produced a new phase separation. Both full view and microscopic views of the direct 
      observation cell were analyzed to determine the evolution of the radii 
      distributions. We found that radii distributions could be well approximated by a 
      lognormal function. The fraction of small radii droplets declined while the fraction 
      of large radii droplets increased over time. Phase separation at the center of the 
      sample cell was visualized using a 12× microscope objective, which corresponds to a 
      depth of focus of about 5 μ m. We found that the mean radii of liquid droplets 
      exhibit a t 1 / 3 evolution, in agreement with growth driven by Brownian 
      coalescence. It was also found that the mean radii of the vapor bubbles inside the 
      liquid majority phase exhibit a t 1 / 2 evolution, which suggest a possible 
      directional motion of vapor bubbles due to the influence of weak remaining 
      gravitational field and/or a composition Marangoni force.

AB  - Most in vitro electrophysiology studies extract information and draw conclusions 
      from representative, temporally limited snapshot experiments. This approach bears 
      the risk of missing decisive moments that may make a difference in our understanding 
      of physiological events. This feasibility study presents a simple benchtop 
      cell-culture perfusion system adapted to commercial microelectrode arrays (MEAs), 
      multichannel electrophysiology equipment and common inverted microscopy stages for 
      simultaneous and uninterrupted extracellular electrophysiology and time-lapse 
      imaging at ambient CO2 levels. The concept relies on a transparent, replica-casted 
      polydimethylsiloxane perfusion cap, gravity- or syringe-pump-driven perfusion and 
      preconditioning of pH-buffered serum-free cell-culture medium to ambient CO2 levels 
      at physiological temperatures. The low-cost microfluidic in vitro enabling platform, 
      which allows us to image cultures immediately after cell plating, is easy to 
      reproduce and is adaptable to the geometries of different cell-culture containers. 
      It permits the continuous and simultaneous multimodal long-term acquisition or 
      manipulation of optical and electrophysiological parameter sets, thereby 
      considerably widening the range of experimental possibilities. Two exemplary 
      proof-of-concept long-term MEA studies on hippocampal networks illustrate system 
      performance. Continuous extracellular recordings over a period of up to 70 days 
      revealed details on both sudden and gradual neural activity changes in maturing cell 
      ensembles with large intra-day fluctuations. Correlated time-lapse imaging unveiled 
      rather static macroscopic network architectures with previously unreported local 
      morphological oscillations on the timescale of minutes.

TI  - Influence of graviceptor stimulation initiated by off-vertical axis rotation on 
      ventilation.
PG  - 1010-1019
LID - 10.1113/EP087035 [doi]
AB  - NEW FINDINGS: What is the central question of this study? It is known that 
      respiration is affected by graviceptors, but it remains unclear to what extent 
      labyrinthine and non-labyrinthine graviceptors are involved in this process. What is 
      the main finding and its importance? Our results suggest that the modulation of 
      respiration is not a result of a simple reflex arc, but that it involves a higher 
      integration of different types of receptors with variable contributions of either 
      type of graviceptor among subjects. ABSTRACT: It has been suggested that the otolith 
      system is involved in the physiological response to changes in body orientation with 
      respect to gravity. In studies on animals, an otolith-respiratory reflex has been 
      observed, but data on humans are scarce and inconclusive, mainly because pure 
      otolithic stimulation is difficult to produce in humans. To assess the 
      otolithic-respiratory reflex in humans, we used an off-vertical axis rotation (OVAR) 
      that produces periodic and pure stimulation of graviceptors. The inspiratory flow 
      was measured during earth vertical axis rotation (EVAR, control conditions) and OVAR 
      in 21 subjects. To distinguish the effects of the labyrinthine and non-labyrinthine 
      graviceptors on ventilation, these measurements were repeated with two different 
      static head positions: head turned leftward and rightward in yaw. The velocity of 
      rotation was individually selected to match spontaneous breathing rate (mean 
      11.4 cycles min(-1) , 0.19 Hz). Average ventilatory flow was higher in OVAR than in 
      EVAR, as was tidal volume. In OVAR, the transition between inspiration and 
      expiration occurred mainly in the forward pitch position. The phase of this 
      transition in most subjects was driven mostly by the body position rather than by 
      the head position, suggesting that respiratory modifications during OVAR mainly 
      involved non-labyrinthine receptors. However, the study demonstrated a high 
      intersubject variability both in the ability of OVAR to synchronize breathing and in 
      the influence of labyrinthine stimulation. We conclude that the respiratory response 
      to changes in orientation of the body with respect to the vertical involves 
      labyrinthine and non-labyrinthine stimulation, with the gain of each signal varying 
      individually.

TI  - Peritoneal dialysis as a mode of treatment for acute kidney injury in sub-Saharan 
      Africa.
PG  - 226-30
LID - 10.1159/000356627 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Developing sustainable treatment programs for kidney failure in most 
      countries of sub-Saharan Africa continues to remain an imposing challenge. While 
      long-term renal replacement therapies in end-stage renal disease appear beyond 
      national financial capabilities, there exist opportunities for a short-term and 
      affordable treatment of acute kidney injury (AKI). Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is an 
      effective and simpler modality compared to hemodialysis (HD) and can be performed 
      without the need for machinery or electricity, making it an ideal choice in a 
      low-resource setting. METHODS: Since cost of treatment is the major obstacle, the 
      goal is to develop a program that is cost effective. Developing an HD program 
      requires a large capital investment by the hospital, needing water treatment systems 
      and machinery and providing for their ongoing repair and maintenance. Gravity-driven 
      PD is a simple, effective modality and can be performed in low-resource locales. 
      RESULTS: In a pediatric program that we started in the Komfo Anokye Teaching 
      Hospital in Kumasi, Ghana, 28 patients have been treated with PD for AKI so far. 
      Half of them were treated successfully and were discharged having fully recovered 
      kidney function. Seven patients (25%) were determined to have end-stage renal 
      disease, whereas 7 others (25%) died during hospitalization. In these cases, late 
      presentation for dialysis may have contributed to the inability to recover. 
      CONCLUSION: For individuals and governments alike, who are concerned about the cost 
      of providing or paying for dialysis, using PD to treat AKI is an effective and 
      simpler modality compared to HD and can be performed without the need for machinery 
      or electricity, making it an ideal choice in a low-resource setting.

AB  - Advancements in technologies for assessing biomechanics at the cellular level have 
      led to discoveries in mechanotransduction and the investigation of cell mechanics as 
      a biomarker for disease. With the recent development of an integrated optical 
      tweezer with micron resolution particle image velocimetry, the opportunity to apply 
      controlled multiaxial stresses to suspended single cells is available (Neve, N., 
      Lingwood, J. K., Zimmerman, J., Kohles, S. S., and Tretheway, D. C., 2008, "The 
      muPIVOT: An Integrated Particle Image Velocimetry and Optical Tweezers Instrument 
      for Microenvironment Investigations," Meas. Sci. Technol., 19(9), pp. 095403). A 
      stress analysis was applied to experimental and theoretical flow velocity gradients 
      of suspended cell-sized polystyrene microspheres demonstrating the relevant geometry 
      of nonadhered spherical cells, as observed for osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and 
      fibroblasts. Three flow conditions were assessed: a uniform flow field generated by 
      moving the fluid sample with an automated translation stage, a gravity driven flow 
      through a straight microchannel, and a gravity driven flow through a microchannel 
      cross junction. The analysis showed that fluid-induced stresses on suspended cells 
      (hydrodynamic shear, normal, and principal stresses in the range of 0.02-0.04 Pa) 
      are generally at least an order of magnitude lower than adhered single cell studies 
      for uniform and straight microchannel flows (0.5-1.0 Pa). In addition, hydrostatic 
      pressures dominate (1-100 Pa) over hydrodynamic stresses. However, in a cross 
      junction configuration, orders of magnitude larger hydrodynamic stresses are 
      possible without the influence of physical contact and with minimal laser trapping 
      power.

AB  - Dynamics in complexes of porphyrin cage compounds and viologen-derived guest 
      molecules are investigated by selective exchange NMR spectroscopy (1D EXSY). 
      Exchange rates were found to be independent of excess guest concentration, revealing 
      a dissociative exchange mechanism, which is accompanied by negative activation 
      entropies, indicating significant reorganization of the host-guest complex during 
      dissociation. Nonsymmetric viologen guests with bulky head groups had more 
      unidirectional binding and slower exchange rates than guests with less-bulky head 
      groups. Thermodynamic and kinetic studies revealed that the exchange process is 
      primarily driven by the thermodynamics of binding and that guest binding can be 
      influenced by introducing steric and electronic groups on the host . Exchange 
      studies with guests bearing a polymer chain revealed that both slippage and full 
      dissociation takes place and the rate constants for both processes were determined. 
      The slippage rate constant revealed that for smaller guests exchange takes place 
      nearly exclusively under thermodynamic control.

TI  - Integrated microfluidic array plate (iMAP) for cellular and molecular analysis.
PG  - 2701-10
LID - 10.1039/c1lc20105k [doi]
AB  - Just as the Petri dish has been invaluable to the evolution of biomedical science in 
      the last 100 years, microfluidic cell assay platforms have the potential to change 
      significantly the way modern biology and clinical science are performed. However, an 
      evolutionary process of creating an efficient microfluidic array for many different 
      bioassays is necessary. Specifically for a complete view of a cell response it is 
      essential to incorporate cytotoxic, protein and gene analysis on a single system. 
      Here we present a novel cellular and molecular analysis platform, which allows 
      access to gene expression, protein immunoassay, and cytotoxicity information in 
      parallel. It is realized by an integrated microfluidic array plate (iMAP). The iMAP 
      enables sample processing of cells, perfusion based cell culture, effective 
      perturbation of biologic molecules or drugs, and simultaneous, real-time optical 
      analysis for different bioassays. The key features of the iMAP design are the 
      interface of on-board gravity driven flow, the open access input fluid exchange and 
      the highly efficient sedimentation based cell capture mechanism (∼100% capture 
      rates). The operation of the device is straightforward (tube and pump free) and 
      capable of handling dilute samples (5-cells per experiment), low reagent volumes (50 
      nL per reaction), and performing single cell protein and gene expression 
      measurements. We believe that the unique low cell number and triple analysis 
      capabilities of the iMAP platform can enable novel dynamic studies of scarce cells.

TI  - AtDRO1 is nuclear localized in root tips under native conditions and impacts auxin 
      localization.

LID - 10.1007/s11103-020-00984-2 [doi]
AB  - DEEPER ROOTING 1 (DRO1) contributes to the downward gravitropic growth trajectory of 
      roots upstream of lateral auxin transport in monocots and dicots. Loss of DRO1 
      function leads to horizontally oriented lateral roots and altered gravitropic set 
      point angle, while loss of all three DRO family members results in upward, vertical 
      root growth. Here, we attempt to dissect the roles of AtDRO1 by analyzing 
      expression, protein localization, auxin gradient formation, and auxin responsiveness 
      in the atdro1 mutant. Current evidence suggests AtDRO1 is predominantly a 
      membrane-localized protein. Here we show that VENUS-tagged AtDRO1 driven by the 
      native AtDRO1 promoter complemented an atdro1 Arabidopsis mutant and the protein was 
      localized in root tips and detectable in nuclei. atdro1 primary and lateral roots 
      showed impairment in establishing an auxin gradient upon gravistimulation as 
      visualized with DII-VENUS, a sensor for auxin signaling and proxy for relative auxin 
      distribution. Additionally, PIN3 domain localization was not significantly altered 
      upon gravistimulation in atdro1 primary and lateral roots. RNA-sequencing revealed 
      differential expression of known root development-related genes in atdro1 mutants. 
      atdro1 lateral roots were able to respond to exogenous auxin and AtDRO1 gene 
      expression levels in root tips were unaffected by the addition of auxin. 
      Collectively, the data suggest that nuclear localization may be important for AtDRO1 
      function and suggests a more nuanced role for DRO1 in regulating auxin-mediated 
      changes in lateral branch angle. KEY MESSAGE: DEEPER ROOTING 1 (DRO1) when expressed 
      from its native promoter is predominately localized in Arabidopsis root tips, 
      detectable in nuclei, and impacts auxin gradient formation.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The gravity, scale, and nature of human rights violations are severe 
      in North Korea. Little is known about the mental health consequences of the lifelong 
      exposures to these violations. METHODS: In 2014-2015, a retrospective study was 
      conducted among 383 North Korean refugees in South Korea using respondent-driven 
      sampling to access this hidden population. This study collected information on the 
      full range of political and economic rights violations and measured post-traumatic 
      stress disorder, anxiety and depression symptoms, and social functioning by standard 
      instruments. Multivariate regression analysis was performed with the adjustment of 
      political, economic, and demographic variables in 2016-2017. RESULTS: The results 
      indicate elevated symptoms of anxiety (60.1%, 95% CI=54.3%, 65.7%), depression 
      (56.3%, 95% CI=50.8%, 61.9%), and post-traumatic stress disorder (22.8%, 95% 
      CI=18.6%, 27.4%), which are significantly associated with exposures to political 
      rights violations (ten to 19 items versus non-exposure: anxiety AOR=16.78, p<0.001, 
      depression AOR=12.52, p<0.001, post-traumatic stress disorder AOR=16.71, p<0.05), 
      and economic rights violations (seven to 13 items versus non-exposure: anxiety 
      AOR=5.68, p<0.001, depression AOR=4.23, p<0.01, post-traumatic stress disorder 
      AOR=5.85, p<0.05). The mean score of social functioning was also lower in those who 
      were exposed to political (adjusted difference= -13.29, p<0.001) and economic rights 
      violations (adjusted difference= -11.20, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study 
      highlights mental health consequences of lifelong human rights violations in North 
      Korea. Beyond the conventional approach, it suggests the need for a collaborative 
      preventive response from global health and human rights activists to address human 
      rights in regard to mental health determinants of the 20 million people in North 
      Korea.

TI  - Magnesium sulfate enhances non-depolarizing muscle relaxant vecuronium action at 
      adult muscle-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in vitro.
PG  - 1454-9
LID - 10.1038/aps.2011.117 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To investigate the effect of magnesium sulfate and its interaction with the 
      non-depolarizing muscle relaxant vecuronium at adult muscle-type acetylcholine 
      receptors in vitro. METHODS: Adult muscle-type acetylcholine receptors were 
      expressed in HEK293 cells. Drug-containing solution was applied via a gravity-driven 
      perfusion system. The inward currents were activated by brief application of 
      acetylcholine (ACh), and recorded using whole-cell voltage-clamp technique. RESULTS: 
      Magnesium sulfate (1-100 mmol/L) inhibited the inward currents induced ACh (10 
      μmol/L) in a concentration-dependent manner (IC(50)=29.2 mmol/L). The inhibition of 
      magnesium sulfate was non-competitive. In contrast, vecuronium produced a potent 
      inhibition on the adult muscle-type acetylcholine receptor (IC(50)=8.7 nmol/L) by 
      competitive antagonism. Magnesium sulfate at the concentrations of 1, 3, and 6 
      mmol/L markedly enhanced the inhibition of vecuronium (10 nmol/L) on adult 
      muscle-type acetylcholine receptors. CONCLUSION: Clinical enhancement of 
      vecuronium-induced muscle relaxation by magnesium sulfate can be attributed partly 
      to synergism between magnesium sulfate and non-depolarizing muscle relaxants at 
      adult muscle-type acetylcholine receptors.

TI  - Otolith deprivation induces optokinetic compensation.
PG  - 3487-96
AB  - According to the multisensory integration theory vestibular, optokinetic and 
      proprioceptive inputs act in concert to maintain a stable retinal image of the 
      visual world. Yet, it remains elusive to what extent the otolith organs contribute 
      to this process and whether a specific loss of otolith input is compensated for. 
      Here we investigated the compensatory eye movements in tilted mice, which lack 
      otoconia because of a mutation in otopetrin 1. Tilted mice showed very small 
      displacements of the eyes in the orbit during static roll paradigms, suggesting the 
      absence of functional otolith organs. Independent of head position with respect to 
      gravity, the gain and phase lead of angular vestibuloocular reflex of tilted mice 
      were decreased and increased, respectively (frequencies 0.2 to 1 Hz and peak 
      accelerations 8 to 197 degrees /s2, respectively). Furthermore, lack of otolith 
      input increases the dependency of the vestibular system on stimulus frequency. In 
      contrast, the gain of optokinetic reflex in tilted mice was significantly higher in 
      the low-frequency range than in control mice, regardless of the position of the mice 
      in space or the plane of the eye movements. To explain these results, a simple model 
      was used in which a multisensory integration unit was embedded. With this model, we 
      were able to simulate all the behaviors observed. Thus our data and the model 
      support the presence of the multisensory integration system and revealed a 
      compensatory enhanced optokinetic reflex in tilted mice, indicating an adaptive 
      synergism in the processing of otolith and visually driven signals.

LID - e62437
AB  - Understanding the effects of spaceflight on microbial communities is crucial for the 
      success of long-term, manned space missions. Surface-associated bacterial 
      communities, known as biofilms, were abundant on the Mir space station and continue 
      to be a challenge on the International Space Station. The health and safety hazards 
      linked to the development of biofilms are of particular concern due to the 
      suppression of immune function observed during spaceflight. While planktonic 
      cultures of microbes have indicated that spaceflight can lead to increases in growth 
      and virulence, the effects of spaceflight on biofilm development and physiology 
      remain unclear. To address this issue, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was cultured during 
      two Space Shuttle Atlantis missions: STS-132 and STS-135, and the biofilms formed 
      during spaceflight were characterized. Spaceflight was observed to increase the 
      number of viable cells, biofilm biomass, and thickness relative to normal gravity 
      controls. Moreover, the biofilms formed during spaceflight exhibited a 
      column-and-canopy structure that has not been observed on Earth. The increase in the 
      amount of biofilms and the formation of the novel architecture during spaceflight 
      were observed to be independent of carbon source and phosphate concentrations in the 
      media. However, flagella-driven motility was shown to be essential for the formation 
      of this biofilm architecture during spaceflight. These findings represent the first 
      evidence that spaceflight affects community-level behaviors of bacteria and 
      highlight the importance of understanding how both harmful and beneficial 
      human-microbe interactions may be altered during spaceflight.

AB  - In recent years, there has been a rise in interest in the development of 
      self-growing robotics inspired by the moving-by-growing paradigm of plants. In 
      particular, climbing plants capitalize on their slender structures to successfully 
      negotiate unstructured environments while employing a combination of two classes of 
      growth-driven movements: tropic responses, growing toward or away from an external 
      stimulus, and inherent nastic movements, such as periodic circumnutations, which 
      promote exploration. In order to emulate these complex growth dynamics in a 3D 
      environment, a general and rigorous mathematical framework is required. Here, we 
      develop a general 3D model for rod-like organs adopting the Frenet-Serret frame, 
      providing a useful framework from the standpoint of robotics control. Differential 
      growth drives the dynamics of the organ, governed by both internal and external cues 
      while neglecting elastic responses. We describe the numerical method required to 
      implement this model and perform numerical simulations of a number of key scenarios, 
      showcasing the applicability of our model. In the case of responses to external 
      stimuli, we consider a distant stimulus (such as sunlight and gravity), a point 
      stimulus (a point light source), and a line stimulus that emulates twining of a 
      climbing plant around a support. We also simulate circumnutations, the response to 
      an internal oscillatory cue, associated with search processes. Lastly, we also 
      demonstrate the superposition of the response to an external stimulus and 
      circumnutations. In addition, we consider a simple example illustrating the possible 
      use of an optimal control approach in order to recover tropic dynamics in a way that 
      may be relevant for robotics use. In all, the model presented here is general and 
      robust, paving the way for a deeper understanding of plant response dynamics and 
      also for novel control systems for newly developed self-growing robots.

AB  - Photosynthetic thylakoid membranes in plants contain highly folded membrane layers 
      enriched in photosystem II, which uses light energy to oxidize water and produce 
      oxygen. The sunlight also causes quantitative phosphorylation of major photosystem 
      II proteins. Analysis of the Arabidopsis thaliana stn7xstn8 double mutant deficient 
      in thylakoid protein kinases STN7 and STN8 revealed light-independent 
      phosphorylation of PsbH protein and greatly reduced N-terminal phosphorylation of D2 
      protein. The stn7xstn8 and stn8 mutants deficient in light-induced phosphorylation 
      of photosystem II had increased thylakoid membrane folding compared with wild-type 
      and stn7 plants. Significant enhancement in the size of stacked thylakoid membranes 
      in stn7xstn8 and stn8 accelerated gravity-driven sedimentation of isolated 
      thylakoids and was observed directly in plant leaves by transmission electron 
      microscopy. Increased membrane folding, caused by the loss of light-induced protein 
      phosphorylation, obstructed lateral migration of the photosystem II reaction center 
      protein D1 and of processing protease FtsH between the stacked and unstacked 
      membrane domains, suppressing turnover of damaged D1 in the leaves exposed to high 
      light. These findings show that the high level of photosystem II phosphorylation in 
      plants is required for adjustment of macroscopic folding of large photosynthetic 
      membranes modulating lateral mobility of membrane proteins and sustained 
      photosynthetic activity.

TI  - NATO and evidence-based military and disaster medicine: case for Vigorous Warrior 
      Live Exercise Series.
PG  - 325-330
LID - 10.21101/cejph.a6045 [doi]
AB  - The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is the premier and only security 
      alliance uniting 30 countries and growing with many partner states in the provision 
      of collective security and against threats posed by conflict and natural disasters. 
      Security of countries and communities is increasingly threatened by a broad spectrum 
      of unconventional types of war and disease threats - from hybrid and asymmetric to 
      multi-domain and peer-to-peer/near-peer conflict. The NATO Centre of Excellence for 
      Military Medicine (MILMED COE) is the centre of gravity for medical best practices 
      and promotion of medical doctrine across the NATO alliance. Disaster medicine is 
      multidisciplinary and in NATO, multinational, requiring best practices that are 
      driven by data and evidence to prevent death on the battlefield and prepare for 
      future conflicts. "Vigorous Warrior" is a live military and disaster medicine 
      exercise series using both civilian and military actors across all sectors of health 
      focused on health security and identifying lessons learned to ready the alliance for 
      future threats. In this brief report, we make the case that the Vigorous Warrior 
      exercise exposes gaps, highlights challenges and generates an evidence base to make 
      NATO military medicine systems more robust, more efficient and in provision of best 
      medical practices. We specifically argue that clinical data capture must be 
      duplicated and continuous across the alliance to ensure evidence-based medicine 
      stays current in NATO military medical doctrine.

TI  - Southward re-distribution of tropical tuna fisheries activity can be explained by 
      technological and management change.
PG  - 511-521
LID - 10.1111/faf.12443 [doi]
AB  - There is broad evidence of climate change causing shifts in fish distribution 
      worldwide, but less is known about the response of fisheries to these changes. 
      Responses to climate-driven shifts in a fishery may be constrained by existing 
      management or institutional arrangements and technological settings. In order to 
      understand how fisheries are responding to ocean warming, we investigate purse seine 
      fleets targeting tropical tunas in the east Atlantic Ocean using effort and sea 
      surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) data from 1991 to 2017. An analysis of the 
      spatial change in effort using a centre of gravity approach and empirical orthogonal 
      functions is used to assess the spatiotemporal changes in effort anomalies and 
      investigate links to SSTA. Both analyses indicate that effort shifts southward from 
      the equator, while no clear pattern is seen northward from the equator. Random 
      forest models show that while technology and institutional settings better explain 
      total effort, SSTA is playing a role when explaining the spatiotemporal changes of 
      effort, together with management and international agreements. These results show 
      the potential of management to minimize the impacts of climate change on fisheries 
      activity. Our results provide guidance for improved understanding about how climate, 
      management and governance interact in tropical tuna fisheries, with methods that are 
      replicable and transferable. Future actions should take into account all these 
      elements in order to plan successful adaptation.

TI  - Decreased otolith-mediated vestibular response in 25 astronauts induced by 
      long-duration spaceflight.
PG  - 3045-51
LID - 10.1152/jn.00065.2016 [doi]
AB  - The information coming from the vestibular otolith organs is important for the brain 
      when reflexively making appropriate visual and spinal corrections to maintain 
      balance. Symptoms related to failed balance control and navigation are commonly 
      observed in astronauts returning from space. To investigate the effect of 
      microgravity exposure on the otoliths, we studied the otolith-mediated responses 
      elicited by centrifugation in a group of 25 astronauts before and after 6 mo of 
      spaceflight. Ocular counterrolling (OCR) is an otolith-driven reflex that is 
      sensitive to head tilt with regard to gravity and tilts of the gravito-inertial 
      acceleration vector during centrifugation. When comparing pre- and postflight OCR, 
      we found a statistically significant decrease of the OCR response upon return. Nine 
      days after return, the OCR was back at preflight level, indicating a full recovery. 
      Our large study sample allows for more general physiological conclusions about the 
      effect of prolonged microgravity on the otolith system. A deconditioned otolith 
      system is thought to be the cause of several of the negative effects seen in 
      returning astronauts, such as spatial disorientation and orthostatic intolerance. 
      This knowledge should be taken into account for future long-term space missions.

      and cell imaging.
PG  - 10670-5
LID - 10.1073/pnas.0804612105 [doi]
AB  - Low-cost and high-resolution on-chip microscopes are vital for reducing cost and 
      improving efficiency for modern biomedicine and bioscience. Despite the needs, the 
      conventional microscope design has proven difficult to miniaturize. Here, we report 
      the implementation and application of two high-resolution (approximately 0.9 microm 
      for the first and approximately 0.8 microm for the second), lensless, and fully 
      on-chip microscopes based on the optofluidic microscopy (OFM) method. These systems 
      abandon the conventional microscope design, which requires expensive lenses and 
      large space to magnify images, and instead utilizes microfluidic flow to deliver 
      specimens across array(s) of micrometer-size apertures defined on a metal-coated 
      CMOS sensor to generate direct projection images. The first system utilizes a 
      gravity-driven microfluidic flow for sample scanning and is suited for imaging 
      elongate objects, such as Caenorhabditis elegans; and the second system employs an 
      electrokinetic drive for flow control and is suited for imaging cells and other 
      spherical/ellipsoidal objects. As a demonstration of the OFM for bioscience 
      research, we show that the prototypes can be used to perform automated phenotype 
      characterization of different Caenorhabditis elegans mutant strains, and to image 
      spores and single cellular entities. The optofluidic microscope design, readily 
      fabricable with existing semiconductor and microfluidic technologies, offers 
      low-cost and highly compact imaging solutions. More functionalities, such as on-chip 
      phase and fluorescence imaging, can also be readily adapted into OFM systems. We 
      anticipate that the OFM can significantly address a range of biomedical and 
      bioscience needs, and engender new microscope applications.

TI  - A first near real-time seismology-based landquake monitoring system.
PG  - 43510
LID - 10.1038/srep43510 [doi]
LID - 43510
AB  - Hazards from gravity-driven instabilities on hillslope (termed 'landquake' in this 
      study) are an important problem facing us today. Rapid detection of landquake events 
      is crucial for hazard mitigation and emergency response. Based on the real-time 
      broadband data in Taiwan, we have developed a near real-time landquake monitoring 
      system, which is a fully automatic process based on waveform inversion that yields 
      source information (e.g., location and mechanism) and identifies the landquake 
      source by examining waveform fitness for different types of source mechanisms. This 
      system has been successfully tested offline using seismic records during the passage 
      of the 2009 Typhoon Morakot in Taiwan and has been in online operation during the 
      typhoon season in 2015. In practice, certain levels of station coverage (station 
      gap < 180°), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR ≥ 5.0), and a threshold of event size 
      (volume >10(6) m(3) and area > 0.20 km(2)) are required to ensure good performance 
      (fitness > 0.6 for successful source identification) of the system, which can be 
      readily implemented in other places in the world with real-time seismic networks and 
      high landquake activities.

TI  - Window on a microworld: simple microfluidic systems for studying microbial transport 
      in porous media.
LID - 1741 [pii]
LID - 10.3791/1741 [doi]
AB  - Microbial growth and transport in porous media have important implications for the 
      quality of groundwater and surface water, the recycling of nutrients in the 
      environment, as well as directly for the transmission of pathogens to drinking water 
      supplies. Natural porous media is composed of an intricate physical topology, varied 
      surface chemistries, dynamic gradients of nutrients and electron acceptors, and a 
      patchy distribution of microbes. These features vary substantially over a length 
      scale of microns, making the results of macro-scale investigations of microbial 
      transport difficult to interpret, and the validation of mechanistic models 
      challenging. Here we demonstrate how simple microfluidic devices can be used to 
      visualize microbial interactions with micro-structured habitats, to identify key 
      processes influencing the observed phenomena, and to systematically validate 
      predictive models. Simple, easy-to-use flow cells were constructed out of the 
      transparent, biocompatible and oxygen-permeable material poly(dimethyl siloxane). 
      Standard methods of photolithography were used to make micro-structured masters, and 
      replica molding was used to cast micro-structured flow cells from the masters. The 
      physical design of the flow cell chamber is adaptable to the experimental 
      requirements: microchannels can vary from simple linear connections to complex 
      topologies with feature sizes as small as 2 microm. Our modular EcoChip flow cell 
      array features dozens of identical chambers and flow control by a gravity-driven 
      flow module. We demonstrate that through use of EcoChip devices, physical structures 
      and pressure heads can be held constant or varied systematically while the influence 
      of surface chemistry, fluid properties, or the characteristics of the microbial 
      population is investigated. Through transport experiments using a non-pathogenic, 
      green fluorescent protein-expressing Vibrio bacterial strain, we illustrate the 
      importance of habitat structure, flow conditions, and inoculums size on fundamental 
      transport phenomena, and with real-time particle-scale observations, demonstrate 
      that microfluidics offer a compelling view of a hidden world.

AB  - The earth's environmental problems, especially for water remediation, need effective 
      methods to solve. Materials with special wettability are developed for the 
      separation of oil/water mixtures. However, the separation of emulsified oil/water 
      mixtures can be a real challenge. There is still much deficiencies, on account of 
      the surfactant, which could link water molecules and oil molecules to form a 
      stabilized system. Here we report a pure inorganic ZnO-Co3O4 overlapped membrane to 
      give a brand new solution to emulsified oil/water mixture separation. Fabricated by 
      an easy and cost-efficient way, such a membrane combines the properties of 
      under-water superoleophobicity and under-oil superhydrophobicity, which can be 
      successfully used for the efficient separation of both surfactant-free and 
      surfactant-stabilized emulsions, solely driven by gravity. This ZnO-Co3O4 overlapped 
      membrane shows great potential applications to industrial wastewater treatment, 
      domestic sewage purification and other water remediation.

AB  - The flow characteristics of a gravity-driven dense granular flow in a granular bed 
      with a contracted drainage orifice are studied by using discrete element method and 
      quantitative analysis. Three values of discharging rates, ranging from fast to slow 
      dense flows, are investigated. Time variations and derivatives of mean forces and 
      velocities, as well as their respective correlations, are analyzed to quantitatively 
      depict the characteristics of granular flow as well as flow regime categorization. 
      The auto-correlation functions, as well as their Fourier spectrums, are utilized to 
      characterize the differences between the mechanisms of slow and fast granular flows. 
      Finally, it is suggested that the flow regimes of slow and fast flows can be 
      characterized by the kinetic and kinematic flow properties of particles.

TI  - Extensive adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation of patterned human mesenchymal 
      stem cells in a microfluidic device.
LID - 10.1039/b926738g
AB  - Microtechnology offers great prospects for cellular research by enabling controlled 
      experimental conditions that cannot be achieved by traditional methods. This study 
      demonstrates the use of a microfluidic platform for long-term cultivation (3 weeks) 
      of human mesenchymal stem-like cells (MSCs), a cell population of high interest for 
      tissue engineering. The typical high motility of the MSCs required a strategy for 
      preventing cells from inhabiting the feeding channels and thus interfere with a 
      steady perfusion of medium to the cell cultivation chamber. Hence, a straightforward 
      and long-term patterning method was developed and implemented for reliable cell 
      positioning within the device. This method was based on the modification of a 
      polystyrene substrate into cell supportive and non-supportive regions by the use of 
      selective oxygen plasma treatment and the triblock copolymer Pluronic. Also, a novel 
      and size-effective "flip-chip" set-up for operating the devices was invented. 
      Successful and reproducible adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation of MSCs in the 
      device was demonstrated, verifying that an adequate long-term microfluidic 
      cultivation environment was obtained. Strengths of the experimental protocol include 
      ease of fabrication and maintenance (gravity driven), good cell performance 
      (viability/differentiation), as well as the possibility of exposing the culture to 
      heterogeneous laminar flow for experimental purposes.

      Board, an 18-month-old patient, diagnosed as being in a vegetative state due to 
      global cerebral ischemia, underwent cell transplantation to the frontal horn of the 
      lateral ventricle, with umbilical cord blood-derived stem cells labeled with 
      superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) contrast agent. The patient was followed over 33 
      months with clinical examinations and MRI. To evaluate the forces governing the 
      distribution of cells within the fluid compartment of the ventricular system in 
      vivo, a gravity-driven sedimentation assay and a magnetic field-driven cell 
      attraction assay were developed in vitro. RESULTS: Twenty-four hours 
      post-transplantation, MR imaging (MRI) was able to detect hypointense cells in the 
      occipital horn of the lateral ventricle. The signal gradually decreased over 4 
      months and became undetectable at 33 months. In vitro, no significant difference in 
      cell sedimentation between SPIO-labeled and unlabeled cells was observed (p = NS). 
      An external magnet was effective in attracting cells over distances comparable to 
      the size of human lateral ventricles. CONCLUSIONS: MR imaging of SPIO-labeled cells 
      allows monitoring of cells within lateral ventricles. While the initial 
      biodistribution is governed by gravity-driven sedimentation, an external magnetic 
      field may possibly be applied to further direct the distribution of labeled cells 
      within large fluid compartments such as the ventricular system.

TI  - Hypothesis: The Vestibular and Cerebellar Basis of the Mal de Debarquement Syndrome.
PG  - 28
LID - 10.3389/fneur.2018.00028 [doi]
LID - 28
AB  - The Mal de Debarquement syndrome (MdDS) generally follows sea voyages, but it can 
      occur after turbulent flights or spontaneously. The primary features are objective 
      or perceived continuous rocking, swaying, and/or bobbing at 0.2 Hz after sea voyages 
      or 0.3 Hz after flights. The oscillations can continue for months or years and are 
      immensely disturbing. Associated symptoms appear to be secondary to the incessant 
      sensation of movement. We previously suggested that the illness can be attributed to 
      maladaptation of the velocity storage integrator in the vestibular system, but the 
      actual neural mechanisms driving the MdDS are unknown. Here, based on experiments in 
      subhuman primates, we propose a series of postulates through which the MdDS is 
      generated: (1) The MdDS is produced in the velocity storage integrator by activation 
      of vestibular-only (VO) neurons on either side of the brainstem that are oscillating 
      back and forth at 0.2 or 0.3 Hz. (2) The groups of VO neurons are driven by signals 
      that originate in Purkinje cells in the cerebellar nodulus. (3) Prolonged exposure 
      to roll, either on the sea or in the air, conditions the roll-related neurons in the 
      nodulus. (4) The prolonged exposure causes a shift of the pitch orientation vector 
      from its original position aligned with gravity to a position tilted in roll. (5) 
      Successful treatment involves exposure to a full-field optokinetic stimulus rotating 
      around the spatial vertical countering the direction of the vestibular imbalance. 
      This is done while rolling the head at the frequency of the perceived rocking, 
      swaying, or bobbing. We also note experiments that could be used to verify these 
      postulates, as well as considering potential flaws in the logic. Important 
      unanswered questions: (1) Why does the MdDS predominantly affect women? (2) What 
      aspect of roll causes the prolongation of the tilted orientation vector, and why is 
      it so prolonged in some individuals? (3) What produces the increase in symptoms of 
      some patients when returning home after treatment, and how can this be avoided? We 
      also posit that the same mechanisms underlie the less troublesome and shorter 
      duration Mal de Debarquement.

TI  - Magnetic Levitation for Soft-Tethered Capsule Colonoscopy Actuated With a Single 
      Permanent Magnet: A Dynamic Control Approach.
PG  - 1224-1231
LID - 10.1109/LRA.2019.2894907 [doi]
AB  - The present letter investigates a novel control approach for magnetically driven 
      soft-tethered capsules for colonoscopy-a potentially painless approach for colon 
      inspection. The focus of this work is on a class of devices composed of a magnetic 
      capsule endoscope actuated by a single external permanent magnet. Actuation is 
      achieved by manipulating the external magnet with a serial manipulator, which in 
      turn produces forces and torques on the internal magnetic capsule. We propose a 
      control strategy which, counteracting gravity, achieves levitation of the capsule. 
      This technique, based on a nonlinear backstepping approach, is able to limit contact 
      with the colon walls, reducing friction, avoiding contact with internal folds, and 
      facilitating the inspection of nonplanar cavities. The approach is validated on an 
      experimental setup, which embodies a general scenario faced in colonoscopy. The 
      experiments show that we can attain 19.5% of contact with the colon wall, compared 
      to the almost 100% of previously proposed approaches. Moreover, we show that the 
      control can be used to navigate the capsule through a more realistic environment-a 
      colon phantom-with reasonable completion time.

TI  - Interspecific variation in prey capture behavior by co-occurring Nepenthes pitcher 
      plants: evidence for resource partitioning or sampling-scheme artifacts?
PG  - e27930
LID - 27930 [pii]
LID - e27930
AB  - Pitcher plants of the genus Nepenthes capture a wide range of arthropod prey for 
      nutritional benefit, using complex combinations of visual and olfactory signals and 
      gravity-driven pitfall trapping mechanisms. In many localities throughout Southeast 
      Asia, several Nepenthes different species occur in mixed populations. Often, the 
      species present at any given location have strongly divergent trap structures and 
      preliminary surveys indicate that different species trap different combinations of 
      arthropod prey, even when growing at the same locality. On this basis, it has been 
      proposed that co-existing Nepenthes species may be engaged in niche segregation with 
      regards to arthropod prey, avoiding direct competition with congeners by deploying 
      traps that have modifications that enable them to target specific prey types. We 
      examined prey capture among 3 multi-species Nepenthes populations in Borneo, finding 
      that co-existing Nepenthes species do capture different combinations of prey, but 
      that significant interspecific variations in arthropod prey combinations can often 
      be detected only at sub-ordinal taxonomic ranks. In all lowland Nepenthes species 
      examined, the dominant prey taxon is Formicidae, but montane Nepenthes trap few (or 
      no) ants and 2 of the 3 species studied have evolved to target alternative sources 
      of nutrition, such as tree shrew feces. Using similarity and null model analyses, we 
      detected evidence for niche segregation with regards to formicid prey among 5 
      lowland, sympatric Nepenthes species in Sarawak. However, we were unable to 
      determine whether these results provide support for the niche segregation 
      hypothesis, or whether they simply reflect unquantified variation in heterogeneous 
      habitats and/or ant communities in the study sites. These findings are used to 
      propose improvements to the design of field experiments that seek to test hypotheses 
      about targeted prey capture patterns in Nepenthes.

PG  - 16023-8
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1206915109 [doi]
AB  - Polarizable colloids are expected to form crystalline equilibrium phases when 
      exposed to a steady, uniform field. However, when colloids become localized this 
      field-induced phase transition arrests and the suspension persists indefinitely as a 
      kinetically trapped, percolated structure. We anneal such gels formed from 
      magneto-rheological fluids by toggling the field strength at varied frequencies. 
      This processing allows the arrested structure to relax periodically to 
      equilibrium--colloid-rich, cylindrical columns. Two distinct growth regimes are 
      observed: one in which particle domains ripen through diffusive relaxation of the 
      gel, and the other where the system-spanning structure collapses and columnar 
      domains coalesce apparently through field-driven interactions. There is a stark 
      boundary as a function of magnetic field strength and toggle frequency 
      distinguishing the two regimes. These results demonstrate how kinetic barriers to a 
      colloidal phase transition are subverted through measured, periodic variation of 
      driving forces. Such directed assembly may be harnessed to create unique materials 
      from dispersions of colloids.

TI  - Marine resource congestion in China: Identifying, measuring, and assessing its

AB  - Research on the sustainable development of the marine economy has conventionally 
      revolved around the relationship between efficiency and development. However, most 
      studies have neglected examining how excessive marine resource inputs under certain 
      conditions may lead to resource congestion that restricts output efficiency and 
      sustainable development. To fill this research gap, we optimized an index system to 
      evaluate the input level of marine resources. Using the data of 11 coastal provinces 
      and cities in China from 2000 to 2016, we calculated the congestion of marine 
      resources and analyzed its spatiotemporal evolution and primary influencing factors. 
      Finally, we separated the inefficiency driven by congestion from pure technical 
      inefficiency. The results showed the following: (1) Grave, long-term marine resource 
      congestion does exist in China, and it has evolved from fast to slow, strong to 
      weak, and agglomeration to dispersion; (2) Congestion in the coastal areas has 
      gradually weakened from north to south, and the center of gravity has experienced a 
      shift from the center of China toward the north; (3) Marine resource congestion is 
      mainly affected by the input of resource and capital, resource endowment, and 
      industrial structure; (4) Factors leading to inefficiencies include resource 
      congestion and long-term pure technical inefficiency. By combining congestion and 
      efficiency, we produce values for studying inefficiency and the sustainable 
      development of the marine economy, with the benefit of providing targeted

TI  - An emigration versus a globalization perspective of the Lebanese physician 
      workforce: a qualitative study.
PG  - 135

AB  - BACKGROUND: Lebanon is witnessing an increased emigration of physicians. The 
      objective of this study was to understand the perceptions of Lebanese policymakers 
      of this emigration, and elicit their proposals for future policies and strategies to 
      deal with this emigration. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured individual 
      interviews with the deans of Lebanon's seven medical schools, the presidents of the 
      two physicians professional associations, and governmental officials. We analyzed 
      the results qualitatively. RESULTS: Participants differed in the assessment of the 
      extent and gravity of emigration. Lebanon has a surplus of physicians, driven 
      largely by the over-production of graduates by a growing number of medical schools. 
      Participants cited advantages and disadvantages of the emigration on the personal, 
      financial, medical education system, healthcare system, and national levels. 
      Proposed strategies included limiting the number of students entering medical 
      schools, creating job opportunities for graduating students, and implementing 
      quality standards. Most participants acknowledged the globalization of the Lebanese 
      physician workforce, including exchanges with the Gulf region, exchanges with 
      developed countries, and the involvement of North American medical education 
      institutions in the region. CONCLUSION: Many Lebanese policy makers, particularly 
      deans of medical schools, perceive the emigration of the physician workforce as an 
      opportunity in the context of the globalization of the profession.

AB  - Herein we demonstrate that switchable, spontaneous, directional-transport ability to 
      both water and oil fluids can be created on fabric materials through wet-chemistry 
      coating and successive UV irradiation treatment. When the fabric showed directional 
      transport to a liquid, it prevented liquids of higher surface tension from 
      penetration, but allowed liquids of lower surface tension to permeate, from either 
      side. The directional transport ability can be switched from one fluid to another 
      simply by heating the fabric at an elevated temperature and then re-irradiating the 
      fabric with UV light for required period of time. By attaching liquid drops 
      vertically upwards to a horizontally-laid fabric, we further demonstrated that this 
      novel directional fluid transport was an automatic process driven by surface 
      property alone, irrespective of gravity's effect. This novel fabric may be useful 
      for development of "smart" textiles and functional membranes for various 
      applications.

      formation under windy conditions in Brachypodium distachyon.
PG  - 335
LID - 10.1186/s12870-020-02544-8 [doi]
LID - 335
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is widely perceived that mechanical or thigmomorphogenic stimuli, 
      such as rubbing and bending by passing animals, wind, raindrop, and flooding, 
      broadly influence plant growth and developmental patterning. In particular, 
      wind-driven mechanical stimulation is known to induce the incidence of radial 
      expansion and shorter and stockier statue. Wind stimulation also affects the 
      adaptive propagation of the root system in various plant species. However, it is 
      unknown how plants sense and transmit the wind-derived mechanical signals to launch 
      appropriate responses, leading to the wind-adaptive root growth. RESULTS: Here, we 
      found that Brachypodium distachyon, a model grass widely used for studies on 
      bioenergy crops and cereals, efficiently adapts to wind-mediated lodging stress by 
      forming adventitious roots (ARs) from nonroot tissues. Experimental dissection of 
      wind stimuli revealed that not bending of the mesocotyls but physical contact of the 
      leaf nodes with soil particles triggers the transcriptional induction of a group of 
      potential auxin-responsive genes encoding WUSCHEL RELATED HOMEOBOX and LATERAL ORGAN 
      BOUNDARIES DOMAIN transcription factors, which are likely to be involved in the 
      induction of AR formation. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings would contribute to further 
      understanding molecular mechanisms governing the initiation and development of ARs, 
      which will be applicable to crop agriculture in extreme wind climates.

      Body.

LID - 10.1038/ncomms13185 [doi]
LID - 13185
AB  - The Altiplano-Puna Magma Body (APMB) in the Central Andes is the largest imaged 
      magma reservoir on Earth, and is located within the second highest orogenic plateau 
      on Earth, the Altiplano-Puna. Although the APMB is a first-order geologic feature 
      similar to the Sierra Nevada batholith, its role in the surface uplift history of 
      the Central Andes remains uncertain. Here we show that a long-wavelength topographic 
      dome overlies the seismically measured extent of the APMB, and gravity data suggest 
      that the uplift is isostatically compensated. Isostatic modelling of the magmatic 
      contribution to dome growth yields melt volumes comparable to those estimated from 
      tomography, and suggests that the APMB growth rate exceeds the peak Cretaceous 
      magmatic flare-up in the Sierran batholith. Our analysis reveals that magmatic 
      addition may provide a contribution to surface uplift on par with lithospheric 
      removal, and illustrates that surface topography may help constrain the magnitude of 
      pluton-scale melt production.

LID - 39545
AB  - Bone loss is a serious problem in spaceflight; however, the initial action of 
      microgravity has not been identified. To examine this action, we performed 
      live-imaging of animals during a space mission followed by transcriptome analysis 
      using medaka transgenic lines expressing osteoblast and osteoclast-specific 
      promoter-driven GFP and DsRed. In live-imaging for osteoblasts, the intensity of 
      osterix- or osteocalcin-DsRed fluorescence in pharyngeal bones was significantly 
      enhanced 1 day after launch; and this enhancement continued for 8 or 5 days. In 
      osteoclasts, the signals of TRAP-GFP and MMP9-DsRed were highly increased at days 4 
      and 6 after launch in flight. HiSeq from pharyngeal bones of juvenile fish at day 2 
      after launch showed up-regulation of 2 osteoblast- and 3 osteoclast- related genes. 
      Gene ontology analysis for the whole-body showed that transcription of genes in the 
      category "nucleus" was significantly enhanced; particularly, 
      transcription-regulators were more up-regulated at day 2 than at day 6. Lastly, we 
      identified 5 genes, c-fos, jun-B-like, pai-1, ddit4 and tsc22d3, which were 
      up-regulated commonly in the whole-body at days 2 and 6, and in the pharyngeal bone 
      at day 2. Our results suggested that exposure to microgravity immediately induced 
      dynamic alteration of gene expression levels in osteoblasts and osteoclasts.

AB  - There is strong interest in windable and stretchable membranes to meet the 
      technological demands of practical water treatments. Oil/water separating membranes 
      of this type is still significantly underdeveloped. Here, we reported a windable and 
      stretchable membrane with three-dimensional structure for efficient oil/water 
      separation. This membrane is made of ZnO nanorods arrays conformally grown on woven 
      carbon microfibers. This three-dimensional architecture endows the fabricated 
      membrane with highly windable and stretchable properties, at the same time ensures 
      ZnO nanorods fully exposed outwards on the membrane surface. Due to its superior 
      hydrophilicity and oleophobicity of ZnO nanorods, this all-inorganic membrane 
      exhibits outstanding antifouling property, with the foulants on membrane surfaces 
      easily removed by simple physical cleaning without chemicals. The membrane can 
      effectively separate both oil/saline-water mixtures and oil-in-water emulsions, 
      solely driven by gravity, with extremely high permeation flux of 20933.4 L m(-2) 
      h(-1) and high separation efficiency over 99%.

AB  - Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is associated with significant morbidity 
      and mortality. The pathophysiology of ARDS includes abnormalities of surfactant 
      function as well as pulmonary inflammation. Immunomodulating drugs, like Lidocaine, 
      have shown some success in decreasing inflammation in ARDS. We attempted to combine 
      surfactant lavage's ability to reverse the surfactant dysfunction, while acting as a 
      vehicle to deliver Lidocaine. Gravity-driven surfactant (Infasurf) lavage (35 ml/kg) 
      was administered alone or mixed with Lidocaine after severe HCl acid injury (0.3 N; 
      3 cc/kg) in neonatal piglets. Treatment groups included: control (C) ( n = 5), 
      surfactant lavage (SL) (35 ml/kg-diluted Infasurf) ( n = 7) and SL mixed with 
      Lidocaine (SL+L) ( n = 7). About 26-27% of the lavage was retained (phospholipid 
      73-74 mg/kg; Lidocaine 1.8 mg/kg). Oxygenation progressively increased in the SL and 
      SL+L groups over the 4-hour period (at 240 min: C = 99 +/- 14; SL = 154 +/- 39; SL+L 
      = 230 +/- 40 mmHg) ( p < 0.05). PaCO(2) increased in all groups from 43 +/- 0.3 to 
      55 +/- 0.7 mmHg. Only SL+L showed a reduction in PaCO(2) (at 240 min: C = 54 +/- 4; 
      SL = 53 +/- 7; SL+L = 49 +/- 2 mmHg) ( p < 0.05). Finally, SL and SL + L had 
      superior characteristics during the quasi-static pressure volume (PV) procedure as 
      compared to Control ( p < 0.05). In our HCl ALI model, SL improved oxygenation and 
      quasi-static lung compliance over C. The pulmonary function effects of SL were 
      further enhanced by the addition of Lidocaine to the surfactant suspension. 
      Combining therapeutic agents with surfactant lavage may be an effective strategy in 
      ALI.

AB  - Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the blood of patients with epithelial malignancies 
      provide a promising and minimally invasive source for early detection of metastasis, 
      monitoring of therapeutic effects and basic research addressing the mechanism of 
      metastasis. In this study, we developed a new filtration-based, sensitive CTC 
      isolation device. This device consists of a 3-dimensional (3D) palladium (Pd) filter 
      with an 8 µm-sized pore in the lower layer and a 30 µm-sized pocket in the upper 
      layer to trap CTCs on a filter micro-fabricated by precise lithography plus 
      electroforming process. This is a simple pump-less device driven by gravity flow and 
      can enrich CTCs from whole blood within 20 min. After on-device staining of CTCs for 
      30 min, the filter cassette was removed from the device, fixed in a cassette holder 
      and set up on the upright fluorescence microscope. Enumeration and isolation of CTCs 
      for subsequent genetic analysis from the beginning were completed within 1.5 hr and 
      2 hr, respectively. Cell spike experiments demonstrated that the recovery rate of 
      tumor cells from blood by this Pd filter device was more than 85%. Single living 
      tumor cells were efficiently isolated from these spiked tumor cells by a 
      micromanipulator, and KRAS mutation, HER2 gene amplification and overexpression, for 
      example, were successfully detected from such isolated single tumor cells. 
      Sequential analysis of blood from mice bearing metastasis revealed that CTC 
      increased with progression of metastasis. Furthermore, a significant increase in the 
      number of CTCs from the blood of patients with metastatic breast cancer was observed 
      compared with patients without metastasis and healthy volunteers. These results 
      suggest that this new 3D Pd filter-based device would be a useful tool for the 
      rapid, cost effective and sensitive detection, enumeration, isolation and genetic 
      analysis of CTCs from peripheral blood in both preclinical and clinical settings.

TI  - Assessing the Impact of a Risk-Based Intervention on Piped Water Quality in Rural 
      Communities: The Case of Mid-Western Nepal.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph15081616 [doi]
LID - 1616
AB  - Ensuring universal access to safe drinking water is a global challenge, especially 
      in rural areas. This research aimed to assess the effectiveness of a risk-based 
      strategy to improve drinking water safety for five gravity-fed piped schemes in 
      rural communities of the Mid-Western Region of Nepal. The strategy was based on 
      establishing community-led monitoring of the microbial water quality and the 
      sanitary status of the schemes. The interventions examined included field-robust 
      laboratories, centralized data management, targeted infrastructure improvements, 
      household hygiene and filter promotion, and community training. The results indicate 
      a statistically significant improvement in the microbial water quality eight months 
      after intervention implementation, with the share of taps and household stored water 
      containers meeting the international guidelines increasing from 7% to 50% and from 
      17% to 53%, respectively. At the study endline, all taps had a concentration of <10 
      CFU Escherichia coli/100 mL. These water quality improvements were driven by 
      scheme-level chlorination, improved hygiene behavior, and the universal uptake of 
      household water treatment. Sanitary inspection tools did not predict microbial water 
      quality and, alone, are not sufficient for decision making. Implementation of this 
      risk-based water safety strategy in remote rural communities can support efforts 
      towards achieving universal water safety.

TI  - Fabrication and Wettability Study of WO(3) Coated Photocatalytic Membrane for 
      Oil-Water Separation: A Comparative Study with ZnO Coated Membrane.

AB  - Superhydrophilic and underwater superoleophobic surfaces were fabricated by facile 
      spray coating of nanostructured WO(3) on stainless steel meshes and compared its 
      performance in oil-water separation with ZnO coated meshes. The gravity driven 
      oil-water separation system was designed using these surfaces as the separation 
      media and it was noticed that WO(3) coated stainless steel mesh showed high 
      separation efficiency (99%), with pore size as high as 150 µm, whereas ZnO coated 
      surfaces failed in the process of oil-water separation when the pore exceeded 50 µm 
      size. Since, nanostructured WO(3) is a well known catalyst, the simultaneous 
      photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants present in the separated water from 
      the oil water separation process were tested using WO(3) coated surfaces under UV 
      radiation and the efficiency of this degradation was found to be quite significant. 
      These results assure that with little improvisation on the oil water separation 
      system, these surfaces can be made multifunctional to work simultaneously for 
      oil-water separation and demineralization of organic pollutants from the separated 
      water. Fabrication of the separating surface, their morphological characteristics, 
      wettability, oil water separation efficiency and photo-catalytic degradation 
      efficiency are enunciated.

TI  - Evidence that protons act as neurotransmitters at vestibular hair cell-calyx 
      afferent synapses.

AB  - Present data support the conclusion that protons serve as an important 
      neurotransmitter to convey excitatory stimuli from inner ear type I vestibular hair 
      cells to postsynaptic calyx nerve terminals. Time-resolved pH imaging revealed 
      stimulus-evoked extrusion of protons from hair cells and a subsequent buildup of 
      [H(+)] within the confined chalice-shaped synaptic cleft (ΔpH ∼ -0.2). Whole-cell 
      voltage-clamp recordings revealed a concomitant nonquantal excitatory postsynaptic 
      current in the calyx terminal that was causally modulated by cleft acidification. 
      The time course of [H(+)] buildup limits the speed of this intercellular signaling 
      mechanism, but for tonic signals such as gravity, protonergic transmission offers a 
      significant metabolic advantage over quantal excitatory postsynaptic currents--an 
      advantage that may have driven the proliferation of postsynaptic calyx terminals in 
      the inner ear vestibular organs of contemporary amniotes.

TI  - Nitric oxide and cGMP signaling in calcium-dependent development of cell polarity in 
      Ceratopteris richardii.
PG  - 94-104
AB  - Single-celled spores of the fern Ceratopteris richardii undergo gravity-directed 
      cell polarity development that is driven by polar calcium currents. Here we present 
      results that establish a role for nitric oxide (NO)/cGMP signaling in transducing 
      the stimulus of gravity to directed polarization of the spores. Application of 
      specific NO donors and scavengers inhibited the calcium-dependent gravity response 
      in a dose-dependent manner. The effects of NO donor exposure were antagonized by 
      application of NO scavenger compounds. Similarly, the guanylate cyclase inhibitors 
      6-anilino-5,8-quinolinedione and 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin, and the 
      phosphodiesterase inhibitor Viagra, which modulate NO-dependent cGMP levels in the 
      cells, disrupted gravity-directed cell polarity in a dose-dependent manner. Viagra 
      effects were antagonized by application of NO scavengers, consistent with the 
      postulate that NO and cGMP are linked in the signaling pathway. To identify other 
      components of the signaling system we analyzed gene expression changes induced by 
      Viagra treatment using microarrays and quantitative real-time reverse 
      transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Preliminary microarray analysis revealed 
      several genes whose expression was significantly altered by Viagra treatment. Three 
      of these genes had strong sequence similarity to key signal transduction or stress 
      response genes and quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain 
      reaction was used to more rigorously quantify the effects of Viagra on their 
      expression in spores and to test how closely these effects could be mimicked by 
      treatment with dibutyryl cGMP. Taken together our results implicate NO and cGMP as 
      downstream effectors that help link the gravity stimulus to polarized growth in C. 
      richardii spores. Sequence data from this article can be found in the GenBank/EMBL 
      data libraries under accession numbers BE 640669 to BE 643506, BQ 086920 to BQ 
      087668, and CV 734654 to CV 736151.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Australian Synchrotron Imaging and Medical Beamline (IMBL) was 
      designed as the world's widest synchrotron X-ray beam, enabling both clinical 
      imaging and therapeutic applications for humans as well as the imaging of large 
      animal models. Our group is developing methods for imaging the airways of newly 
      developed CF animal models that display human-like lung disease, such as the CF pig, 
      and we expect that the IMBL can be utilised to image airways in animals of this 
      size. METHODS: This study utilised samples of excised tracheal tissue to assess the 
      feasibility, logistics and protocols required for airway imaging in large animal 
      models such as pigs and sheep at the IMBL. We designed an image processing algorithm 
      to automatically track and quantify the tracheal mucociliary transport (MCT) 
      behaviour of 103 μm diameter high refractive index (HRI) glass bead marker particles 
      deposited onto the surface of freshly-excised normal sheep and pig tracheae, and 
      assessed the effects of airway rehydrating aerosols. RESULTS: We successfully 
      accessed and used scavenged tracheal tissue, identified the minimum bead size that 
      is visible using our chosen imaging setup, verified that MCT could be visualised, 
      and that our automated tracking algorithm could quantify particle motion. The 
      imaging sequences show particles propelled by cilia, against gravity, up the airway 
      surface, within a well-defined range of clearance speeds and with examples of 
      'clumping' behaviour that is consistent with the in vivo capture and mucus-driven 
      transport of particles. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that the wide beam at 
      the IMBL is suitable for imaging MCT in ex vivo tissue samples. We are now 
      transitioning to in vivo imaging of MCT in live pigs, utilising higher X-ray 
      energies and shorter exposures to minimise motion blur.

TI  - The Haselgebirge evaporitic mélange in central Northern Calcareous Alps (Austria): 
      Part of the Permian to Lower Triassic rift of the Meliata ocean?
PG  - 28-48
AB  - For the reconstruction of Alpine tectonics of the Eastern Alps, the evaporitic 
      Permian to Lower Triassic Haselgebirge Formation plays a key role in (1) the origin 
      of Haselgebirge bearing nappes, (2) the inclusion of magmatic and metamorphic rocks 
      revealing tectonic processes not preserved in other units, and (3) the debated mode 
      of emplacement of the nappes, namely gravity-driven or tectonic. Within the Moosegg 
      quarry of the central Northern Calcareous Alps gypsum/anhydrite bodies are 
      tectonically mixed with lenses of sedimentary rocks and decimeter- to meter-sized 
      tectonic clasts of plutonic and subvolcanic rocks and rare metamorphics. We examined 
      various types of (1) widespread biotite-diorite, meta-syenite, (2) meta-dolerite and 
      rare ultramafic rocks (serpentinite, pyroxenite) as well as (3) rare metamorphic 
      banded meta-psammitic schists and meta-doleritic blueschists. The apparent 
      (40)Ar/(39)Ar biotite ages from three biotite-diorite, meta-dolerite and 
      meta-doleritic blueschist samples with variable composition and fabrics range from 
      248 to 270 Ma (e.g., 251.2 ± 1.1 Ma) indicating a Permian age of cooling after magma 
      crystallisation or metamorphism. The chemical composition of biotite-diorite and 
      meta-syenite indicates an alkaline trend interpreted to represent a rift-related 
      magmatic suite. These, as well as Permian to Jurassic sedimentary rocks, were 
      incorporated during Cretaceous nappe emplacement forming the sulphatic Haselgebirge 
      mélange. The scattered (40)Ar/(39)Ar white mica ages of a meta-doleritic blueschist 
      (of N-MORB origin) and banded meta-psammitic schist are ca. 349 and 378 Ma, 
      respectively, proving the Variscan age of pressure-dominated metamorphism. These 
      ages are similar to detrital white mica ages reported from the underlying Rossfeld 
      Formations, indicating a close source-sink relationship. According to our new data, 
      the Haselgebirge bearing nappe was transported over the Lower Cretaceous Rossfeld 
      Formations, which include many clasts derived from the Haselgebirge Formation and 
      its exotic blocks deposited in front of the incoming nappe comprising the 
      Haselgebirge Formation.

TI  - Physical restraint in the ICU: does it prevent device removal?
PG  - 1086-95
AB  - BACKGROUND: Physical restraint is frequently used in the intensive care setting but 
      little is known regarding its clinical scenario and effectiveness in preventing 
      adverse events (AEs), defined as device removal. METHODS: We carried out a 
      prospective observational study in three Intensive Care Units on 120 adult high-risk 
      patients. The effectiveness of physical restraint was evaluated using the propensity 
      score methodology in order to obtain comparable groups. RESULTS: Physical restraint 
      was applied in 1371 of 3256 (43%) nurse shifts accounting for 120 patients. 
      Substantial agitation, the nurse's judgement of insufficient sedation and sedative 
      drug reduction were positively associated with physical restraint, whereas the 
      presence of analgesics at admission, increased disease gravity and the treating 
      hospital as the most substantial variable showed a negative association. Eighty-six 
      AEs were observed in 44 patients. Quiet (SAS=1-4), unrestrained patients accounted 
      for 40 cases, and agitated (SAS≥5) but physically restrained patients for 17 cases. 
      The presence of any type of physical restraint had a protective effect against any 
      type of AE (OR=0.28; CI 0.16-0.51). The observed AEs showed a limited impact on the 
      patients' course of illness. No physical harm related to physical restraint was 
      reported. CONCLUSION: Physical restraint efficiently averts AEs. Its application is 
      mainly driven by local habits. Typically, the almost recovered, apparently calm and 
      hence unrestrained patient is at greatest risk for undesirable device removal. The 
      control/interpretation of the patient's analgo-sedation might be inappropriate.

TI  - Quantifying Microstegium vimineum seed movement by non-riparian water dispersal 
      using an ultraviolet-marking based recapture method.
PG  - e63811
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0063811 [doi]
LID - e63811
AB  - Microstegium vimineum is a shade tolerant annual C4 invasive grass in the Eastern 
      US, which has been shown to negatively impact species diversity and succession in 
      hardwood forests. To date, empirical studies have shown that population expansion is 
      limited to <1 m yr(-1), which is largely driven by gravity dispersal. However, this 
      likely does not fully account for all mechanisms of population-scale dispersal as we 
      observe greater rates of population expansion. Though water, both riparian and 
      non-riparian water (i.e., ephemeral overland flow), have been speculated mechanisms 
      for M. vimineum dispersal, few studies have empirically tested this hypothesis. We 
      designed an experiment along the slopes of a Southwest Virginia hardwood forest to 
      test the role of non-riparian water on local seed dispersal. We developed a seed 
      marking technique by coating each seed with an ultraviolet (UV) powder that did not 
      affect buoyancy to aid in situ seed recapture. Additionally, a new image analysis 
      protocol was developed to automate seed identification from UV photos. Total seed 
      mobility (summation of individual seed movement within each transect) was positively 
      correlated with precipitation. Over a period of one month with 52.32 mm of 
      precipitation, the maximum dispersal distance of any single recaptured seed was 2.4 
      m, and the average distance of dispersed seed was 0.21±0.04 m. This is the first 
      quantitative evidence of non-riparian water dispersal in a forest understory, which 
      accounts for an additional pathway of population expansion.

LID - e1005210
AB  - In 2014-2016, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia in West Africa experienced the 
      largest and longest Ebola epidemic since the discovery of the virus in 1976. During 
      the epidemic, incidence data were collected and published at increasing resolution. 
      To monitor the epidemic as it spread within and between districts, we develop an 
      analysis method that exploits the full spatiotemporal resolution of the data by 
      combining a local model for time-varying effective reproduction numbers with a 
      gravity-type model for spatial dispersion of the infection. We test this method in 
      simulations and apply it to the weekly incidences of confirmed and probable cases 
      per district up to June 2015, as reported by the World Health Organization. Our 
      results indicate that, of the newly infected cases, only a small percentage, between 
      4% and 10%, migrates to another district, and a minority of these migrants, between 
      0% and 23%, leave their country. The epidemics in the three countries are found to 
      be similar in estimated effective reproduction numbers, and in the probability of 
      importing infection into a district. The countries might have played different roles 
      in cross-border transmissions, although a sensitivity analysis suggests that this 
      could also be related to underreporting. The spatiotemporal analysis method can 
      exploit available longitudinal incidence data at different geographical locations to 
      monitor local epidemics, determine the extent of spatial spread, reveal the 
      contribution of local and imported cases, and identify sources of introductions in 
      uninfected areas. With good quality data on incidence, this data-driven method can 
      help to effectively control emerging infections.

TI  - Dynamics of GPIIb/IIIa-mediated platelet-platelet interactions in platelet 
      adhesion/thrombus formation on collagen in vitro as revealed by videomicroscopy.
PG  - 929-36
AB  - The conventional description of platelet interactions with collagen-coated surfaces 
      in vitro, based on serial static measurements, is that platelets first adhere and 
      spread to form a monolayer and then recruit additional layers of platelets. To 
      obtain dynamic information, we studied gravity-driven platelet deposition in vitro 
      on purified type 1 collagen by video phase-contrast microscopy at 22 degrees C. With 
      untreated human and wild-type mouse platelets, soon after the initial adhesion of a 
      small number of "vanguard" platelets, "follower" platelets attached to the 
      spread-out vanguard platelets. Follower platelets then adhered to and spread onto 
      nearby collagen or over the vanguard platelets. Thus, thrombi formed as a concerted 
      process rather than as sequential processes. Treatment of human platelets with 
      monoclonal antibody (mAb) 7E3 (anti-GPIIb/IIIa (alphaIIbbeta3) + alphaVbeta3) or 
      tirofiban (anti-GPIIb/IIIa) did not prevent platelet adhesion but nearly eliminated 
      the deposition of follower platelets onto vanguard platelets and platelet thrombi. 
      Similar results were obtained with Glanzmann thrombasthenia platelets. Wild-type 
      mouse platelets in the presence of mAb 1B5 (anti-GPIIb/IIIa) and platelets from 
      beta3-null mice behaved like human platelets in the presence of 7E3 or tirofiban. 
      Deposition patterns of untreated human and wild-type mouse platelets were consistent 
      with random distributions under a Poisson model, but those obtained with 7E3- and 
      tirofiban-treated human platelets, 1B5-treated mouse platelets, or beta3-null 
      platelets demonstrated a more uniform deposition than predicted. Thus, in this model 
      system, absence or blockade of GPIIb/IIIa receptors interferes with thrombus 
      formation and alters the pattern of platelet deposition.

TI  - Multi-Model- and Soft-Transition-Based Height Soft Sensor for an Air Cushion 
      Furnace.
LID - 10.3390/s20030926 [doi]
LID - 926
AB  - The floating height of the strip in an air cushion furnace is a key parameter for 
      the quality and efficiency of production. However, the high temperature and high 
      pressure of the working environment prevents the floating height from being directly 
      measured. Furthermore, the strip has multiple floating states in the whole operation 
      process. It is thus difficult to employ a single model to accurately describe the 
      floating height in different states. This paper presents a multi-model soft sensor 
      to estimate the height based on state identification and the soft transition. First, 
      floating states were divided using a partition method that combined adaptive 
      k-nearest neighbors and principal component analysis theories. Based on the 
      identified results, a hybrid model for the stable state, involving a double-random 
      forest model for the vibration state and a soft-transition model, was created to 
      predict the strip floating height. In the hybrid model for the stable state, a 
      mechanistic model combined thick jet theory and the equilibrium equation of force to 
      cope with the lower floating height. In addition, a novel soft-transition model 
      based on data gravitation that further reflects the intrinsic process characteristic 
      was developed for the transition state. The effectiveness of the proposed approach 
      was validated using a self-developed air cushion furnace experimental platform. This 
      study has important value for the process prediction and control of air cushion 
      furnaces.

TI  - Repeated large-scale retreat and advance of Totten Glacier indicated by inland bed 
      erosion.
PG  - 385-9
LID - 10.1038/nature17447 [doi]
AB  - Climate variations cause ice sheets to retreat and advance, raising or lowering sea 
      level by metres to decametres. The basic relationship is unambiguous, but the 
      timing, magnitude and sources of sea-level change remain unclear; in particular, the 
      contribution of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) is ill defined, restricting our 
      appreciation of potential future change. Several lines of evidence suggest possible 
      collapse of the Totten Glacier into interior basins during past warm periods, most 
      notably the Pliocene epoch, causing several metres of sea-level rise. However, the 
      structure and long-term evolution of the ice sheet in this region have been 
      understood insufficiently to constrain past ice-sheet extents. Here we show that 
      deep ice-sheet erosion-enough to expose basement rocks-has occurred in two regions: 
      the head of the Totten Glacier, within 150 kilometres of today's grounding line; and 
      deep within the Sabrina Subglacial Basin, 350-550 kilometres from this grounding 
      line. Our results, based on ICECAP aerogeophysical data, demarcate the marginal 
      zones of two distinct quasi-stable EAIS configurations, corresponding to the 
      'modern-scale' ice sheet (with a marginal zone near the present ice-sheet margin) 
      and the retreated ice sheet (with the marginal zone located far inland). The 
      transitional region of 200-250 kilometres in width is less eroded, suggesting 
      shorter-lived exposure to eroding conditions during repeated retreat-advance events, 
      which are probably driven by ocean-forced instabilities. Representative ice-sheet 
      models indicate that the global sea-level increase resulting from retreat in this 
      sector can be up to 0.9 metres in the modern-scale configuration, and exceeds 
      2 metres in the retreated configuration.

TI  - Effective control of Schistosoma haematobium infection in a Ghanaian community 
      following installation of a water recreation area.
PG  - e1709
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0001709 [doi]
LID - e1709
AB  - BACKGROUND: Urogenital schistosomiasis caused by Schistosoma haematobium was endemic 
      in Adasawase, Ghana in 2007. Transmission was reported to be primarily through 
      recreational water contact. METHODS: We designed a water recreation area (WRA) to 
      prevent transmission to school-aged children. The WRA features a concrete pool 
      supplied by a borehole well and a gravity-driven rainwater collection system; it is 
      30 m(2) and is split into shallow and deep sections to accommodate a variety of age 
      groups. The WRA opened in 2009 and children were encouraged to use it for recreation 
      as opposed to the local river. We screened children annually for S. haematobium eggs 
      in their urine in 2008, 2009, and 2010 and established differences in infection 
      rates before (2008-09) and after (2009-10) installation of the WRA. After each 
      annual screening, children were treated with praziquantel and rescreened to confirm 
      parasite clearance. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Initial baseline testing in 2008 established 
      that 105 of 247 (42.5%) children were egg-positive. In 2009, with drug treatment 
      alone, the pre-WRA annual cumulative incidence of infection was 29 of 216 (13.4%). 
      In 2010, this incidence rate fell significantly (p<0.001, chi-squared) to 9 of 245 
      (3.7%) children after installation of the WRA. Logistic regression analysis was used 
      to determine correlates of infection among the variables age, sex, distance between 
      home and river, minutes observed at the river, low height-for-age, low 
      weight-for-age, low Body Mass Index (BMI)-for-age, and previous infection status. 
      CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: The installation and use of a WRA is a feasible and highly 
      effective means to reduce the incidence of schistosomiasis in school-aged children 
      in a rural Ghanaian community. In conjunction with drug treatment and education, 
      such an intervention can represent a significant step towards the control of 
      schistosomiasis. The WRA should be tested in other water-rich endemic areas to 
      determine whether infection prevalence can be substantially reduced.

TI  - Responses of reticulospinal neurons in the lamprey to lateral turns.
PG  - 512-21
AB  - When swimming, the lamprey maintains a definite orientation of its body in the 
      vertical planes, in relation to the gravity vector, as the result of postural 
      vestibular reflexes. Do the vestibular-driven mechanisms also play a role in the 
      control of the direction of swimming in the horizontal (yaw) plane, in which the 
      gravity cannot be used as a reference direction? In the present study, we addressed 
      this question by recording responses to lateral turns in reticulospinal (RS) neurons 
      mediating vestibulospinal reflexes. In intact lampreys, the activity of axons of RS 
      neurons was recorded in the spinal cord by implanted electrodes. Vestibular 
      stimulation was performed by periodical turns of the animal in the yaw plane (60 
      degrees peak to peak). It was found that the majority of responding RS neurons were 
      activated by the contralateral turn. By removing one labyrinth, we found that yaw 
      responses in RS neurons were driven mainly by input from the contralateral 
      labyrinth. We suggest that these neurons, when activated by the contralateral turn, 
      will elicit the ipsilateral turn and thus will compensate for perturbations of the 
      rectilinear swimming caused by external factors. It is also known that unilateral 
      eye illumination elicits a contralateral turn in the yaw plane (negative 
      phototaxis). We found that a portion of RS neurons were activated by the 
      contralateral eye illumination. By eliciting an ipsilateral turn, these neurons 
      could mediate the negative phototaxis.

AB  - Plants and animals produce modular developmental units in a periodic fashion. In 
      plants, lateral roots form as repeating units along the root primary axis; however, 
      the developmental mechanism regulating this process is unknown. We found that cyclic 
      expression pulses of a reporter gene mark the position of future lateral roots by 
      establishing prebranch sites and that prebranch site production and root bending are 
      periodic. Microarray and promoter-luciferase studies revealed two sets of genes 
      oscillating in opposite phases at the root tip. Genetic studies show that some 
      oscillating transcriptional regulators are required for periodicity in one or both 
      developmental processes. This molecular mechanism has characteristics that resemble 
      molecular clock-driven activities in animal species.

TI  - Contributions of muscles to mediolateral ground reaction force over a range of 
      walking speeds.
PG  - 2438-43
LID - 10.1016/j.jbiomech.2012.06.037 [doi]
AB  - Impaired control of mediolateral body motion during walking is an important health 
      concern. Developing treatments to improve mediolateral control is challenging, 
      partly because the mechanisms by which muscles modulate mediolateral ground reaction 
      force (and thereby modulate mediolateral acceleration of the body mass center) 
      during unimpaired walking are poorly understood. To investigate this, we examined 
      mediolateral ground reaction forces in eight unimpaired subjects walking at four 
      speeds and determined the contributions of muscles, gravity, and velocity-related 
      forces to the mediolateral ground reaction force by analyzing muscle-driven 
      simulations of these subjects. During early stance (0-6% gait cycle), peak ground 
      reaction force on the leading foot was directed laterally and increased 
      significantly (p<0.05) with walking speed. During early single support (14-30% gait 
      cycle), peak ground reaction force on the stance foot was directed medially and 
      increased significantly (p<0.01) with speed. Muscles accounted for more than 92% of 
      the mediolateral ground reaction force over all walking speeds, whereas gravity and 
      velocity-related forces made relatively small contributions. Muscles coordinate 
      mediolateral acceleration via an interplay between the medial ground reaction force 
      contributed by the abductors and the lateral ground reaction forces contributed by 
      the knee extensors, plantarflexors, and adductors. Our findings show how muscles 
      that contribute to forward progression and body-weight support also modulate 
      mediolateral acceleration of the body mass center while weight is transferred from 
      one leg to another during double support.

TI  - Mechanical Properties and Concentrations of Poly(ethylene glycol) in Hydrogels and 
      Brushes Direct the Surface Transport of Staphylococcus aureus.
PG  - 320-330
LID - 10.1021/acsami.8b18302 [doi]
AB  - Surface-associated transport of flowing bacteria, including cell rolling, is a 
      mechanism for otherwise immobile bacteria to migrate on surfaces and could be 
      associated with biofilm formation or the spread of infection. This work demonstrates 
      how the moduli and/or local polymer concentration play critical roles in sustaining 
      contact, dynamic adhesion, and transport of bacterial cells along a hydrogel or 
      hydrated brush surface. In particular, stiffer more concentrated hydrogels and 
      brushes maintained the greatest dynamic contact, still allowing cells to travel 
      along the surface in flow. This study addressed how the mechanical properties, 
      molecular architectures, and thicknesses of minimally adhesive poly(ethylene glycol) 
      (PEG)-based coatings influence the flow-driven surface motion of Staphylococcus 
      aureus MS2 cells. Three protein-repellant PEG-dimethylacrylate hydrogel films (∼100 
      μm thick) and two protein-repellant PEG brushes (8-16 nm thick) were sufficiently 
      fouling-resistant to prevent the accumulation of flowing bacteria. However, the 
      rolling or hopping-like motions of gently flowing S. aureus cells along the surfaces 
      were specific to the particular hydrogel or brush, distinguishing these coatings in 
      terms of their mechanical properties (with moduli from 2 to 1300 kPa) or local PEG 
      concentrations (in the range 10-50% PEG). On the stiffer hydrogel coatings having 
      higher PEG concentrations, S. aureus exhibited long runs of surface rolling, 20-50 
      μm in length, an increased tendency of cells to repeatedly return to some surfaces 
      after rolling and escaping, and relatively long integrated contact times. By 
      contrast, on the softer more dilute hydrogels, bacteria tended to encounter the 
      surface for brief periods before escaping without return. The dynamic adhesion and 
      motion signatures of the cells on the two brushes were bracketed by those on the 
      soft and stiff hydrogels, demonstrating that PEG coating thickness was not important 
      in these studies where the vertically oriented surfaces minimized the impact of 
      gravitational forces. Control studies with similarly sized poly(ethylene 
      oxide)-coated rigid spherical microparticles, that also did not arrest on the PEG 
      coatings, established that the bacterial skipping and rolling signatures were 
      specific to the S. aureus cells and not simply diffusive. Dynamic adhesion of the S. 
      aureus cells on the PEG hydrogel surfaces correlated well with quiescent 24 h 
      adhesion studies in the literature, despite the orientation of the flow studies that 
      eliminated the influence of gravity on bacteria-coating normal forces.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Cardiovascular complications are common in astronauts returning 
      from a prolonged spaceflight. These health problems might be driven by complex 
      modulations of gene expression and protein synthesis in endothelial cells (ECs). 
      Studies on the influence of microgravity on phenotype, growth pattern and biological 
      processes of ECs can help to understand these complications. METHODS: We exposed ECs 
      (EA.hy926) to a Random Positioning Machine (RPM). Proteins associated with cell 
      structure, angiogenesis and endothelial dysfunction were investigated in distinct 
      pools of multicellular spheroids (MCS), adherent cells (AD) and tubular structures 
      (TS) formed after a 35-day RPM-exposure. RESULTS: Combining morphological and 
      molecular approaches, we found AD, MCS and TS with changes in the synthesis and 
      release of proteins involved in three-dimensional growth. Fibronectin and monocyte 
      chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) mRNAs and protein contents were elevated along 
      with an increased secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), 
      interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, MCP-1, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), 
      vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), neutrophil gelatinase-associated 
      lipocalin (NGAL) and regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted 
      (RANTES) proteins in the culture supernatant as determined by multianalyte profiling 
      technology. Together they form a network of interaction. CONCLUSIONS: These results 
      show that a prolonged RPM-exposure of ECs induced TS and MCS formation. The factors 
      VEGF, NGAL, IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, VCAM-1, ICAM-1, fibronectin and RANTES seem to be 
      affected when gravity is omitted.

TI  - Differential diagnosis and proper treatment of acute rhinosinusitis: Guidance based 
      on historical data analysis.
PG  - 45-52
LID - 10.2500/ar.2017.8.0206 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The time course of rhinovirus positive and negative rhinosinusitis has 
      not been quantified yet, which aggravates proper selection and justification of the 
      optimum treatment for this illness. Such quantitative information would facilitate 
      an early and proper identification of the disease and its differentiation from acute 
      bacterial rhinosinusitis, and could diminish harmful overuse of antibiotics, 
      arguably driven by patients' want for attention and the treating physicians' 
      inability to offer an adequate verbal comfort in its stead. OBJECTIVE: Extraction of 
      the quantitative information needed to identify rhinovirus positive or negative 
      rhinosinusitis and to allow selection of the most appropriate treatment from the 
      published time dependence of individual clinical symptoms of the disease. METHODS: 
      Scrutiny (and modeling) of temporal evolution of all noteworthy symptoms of 
      rhinosinusitis with a simple mathematical expression that relies on two adjustable 
      parameters per symptom (and potentially a general time offset as an extra adjustable 
      parameter). RESULTS: Adverse effects of rhinosinusitis can be grouped according to 
      the sequence of their exponential appearance and ∼2.6 times slower exponential 
      disappearance, rhinovirus negative rhinosinusitis generally improving ∼25% faster 
      and being ∼40% less severe. The major early local symptoms (throat soreness and 
      scratchiness, headache) vanish with a half-life of ∼1.8 days, whereas further local 
      symptoms take ∼1.6 times longer to disappear. At least 50-60% improvement of two 
      prominent early symptoms, sore throat and sneezing (but not of nasal discharge, 
      cough, and hoarseness) by day 5 of the disease implies a nonbacterial origin of 
      rhinitis and should exclude use of antibiotics. CONCLUSION: Temporal evolution of 
      all rhinosinusitis symptoms is qualitatively similar, which makes the early symptom 
      decay a good proxy for, and predictor of, the disease perspective. Knowing a symptom 
      intensity at just three to four time points suffices for reconstructing its entire 
      time course and total intensity or gravity. This permits an easy and early 
      identification of rhinosinusitis, and its plausible differentiation from acute 
      bacterial rhinosinusitis, disease treatment optimization, and corresponding clinical 
      trials simplification and/or shortening.

TI  - Do elevated gravitational-force events while driving predict crashes and near 
      crashes?
PG  - 1075-9
LID - 10.1093/aje/kwr440 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this research was to determine the extent to which elevated 
      gravitational-force event rates predict crashes and near crashes. Accelerometers, 
      global positioning systems, cameras, and other technology were installed in vehicles 
      driven by 42 newly licensed Virginia teenage drivers for a period of 18 months 
      between 2006 and 2009. Elevated gravitational force and crash and near-crash events 
      were identified, and rates per miles driven were calculated. (One mile = 1.6 km.) 
      The correlation between crashes and near crashes and elevated gravitational-force 
      event rates was 0.60. Analyses were done by using generalized estimating equations 
      with logistic regression. Higher elevated gravitational-force event rates in the 
      past month substantially increased the risk of a crash in the subsequent month (odds 
      ratio = 1.07, 95% confidence interval: 1.02, 1.12). Although the difference in this 
      relation did not vary significantly by time, it was highest in the first 6 months 
      compared with the second and third 6-month periods. With a receiver operating 
      characteristic curve, the risk models showed relatively high predictive accuracy 
      with an area under the curve of 0.76. The authors conclude that elevated 
      gravitational-force event rates can be used to assess risk and to show high 
      predictive accuracy of a near-future crash.

TI  - Atmospheric confinement of jet streams on Uranus and Neptune.
PG  - 344-7
LID - 10.1038/nature12131 [doi]
AB  - The observed cloud-level atmospheric circulation on the outer planets of the Solar 
      System is dominated by strong east-west jet streams. The depth of these winds is a 
      crucial unknown in constraining their overall dynamics, energetics and internal 
      structures. There are two approaches to explaining the existence of these strong 
      winds. The first suggests that the jets are driven by shallow atmospheric processes 
      near the surface, whereas the second suggests that the atmospheric dynamics extend 
      deeply into the planetary interiors. Here we report that on Uranus and Neptune the 
      depth of the atmospheric dynamics can be revealed by the planets' respective gravity 
      fields. We show that the measured fourth-order gravity harmonic, J4, constrains the 
      dynamics to the outermost 0.15 per cent of the total mass of Uranus and the 
      outermost 0.2 per cent of the total mass of Neptune. This provides a stronger limit 
      to the depth of the dynamical atmosphere than previously suggested, and shows that 
      the dynamics are confined to a thin weather layer no more than about 1,000 
      kilometres deep on both planets.

TI  - Analysis of squat and stoop dynamic liftings: muscle forces and internal spinal 
      loads.
PG  - 687-99
AB  - Despite the well-recognized role of lifting in back injuries, the relative 
      biomechanical merits of squat versus stoop lifting remain controversial. In vivo 
      kinematics measurements and model studies are combined to estimate trunk muscle 
      forces and internal spinal loads under dynamic squat and stoop lifts with and 
      without load in hands. Measurements were performed on healthy subjects to collect 
      segmental rotations during lifts needed as input data in subsequent model studies. 
      The model accounted for nonlinear properties of the ligamentous spine, wrapping of 
      thoracic extensor muscles to take curved paths in flexion and trunk dynamic 
      characteristics (inertia and damping) while subject to measured kinematics and 
      gravity/external loads. A dynamic kinematics-driven approach was employed accounting 
      for the spinal synergy by simultaneous consideration of passive structures and 
      muscle forces under given posture and loads. Results satisfied kinematics and 
      dynamic equilibrium conditions at all levels and directions. Net moments, muscle 
      forces at different levels, passive (muscle or ligamentous) forces and internal 
      compression/shear forces were larger in stoop lifts than in squat ones. These were 
      due to significantly larger thorax, lumbar and pelvis rotations in stoop lifts. For 
      the relatively slow lifting tasks performed in this study with the lowering and 
      lifting phases each lasting approximately 2 s, the effect of inertia and damping was 
      not, in general, important. Moreover, posterior shift in the position of the 
      external load in stoop lift reaching the same lever arm with respect to the S1 as 
      that in squat lift did not influence the conclusion of this study on the merits of 
      squat lifts over stoop ones. Results, for the tasks considered, advocate squat 
      lifting over stoop lifting as the technique of choice in reducing net moments, 
      muscle forces and internal spinal loads (i.e., moment, compression and shear force).

TI  - Development of a mechanistic model to represent the dynamics of particle flow out of 
      the rumen and to predict rate of passage of forage particles in dairy cattle.
PG  - 3981-4000
LID - 10.3168/jds.2006-799 [doi]
AB  - A mechanistic and dynamic model was developed to represent physiological aspects of 
      particle dynamics in the reticulo-rumen (RR) and to predict rate of passage out of 
      the RR (Kp) of forage particles quantitatively. The model consists of 2 conceptual 
      pools with 3 spatial compartments of particles; the compartment the particle enters 
      is based on functional specific gravity (FSG). The model assumes 2 major pressure 
      gradient-driven flows of particles out of the RR through the reticulo-omasal orifice 
      between 2 consecutive primary reticular contractions. One is associated with the 
      second phase of primary reticular contraction and involves propulsion of particles 
      in the vicinity of the honeycomb structure of the reticulum from the RR. The second 
      flow involves movement of particles in the reticulum without selection by size. 
      Particle outflow rate was assumed to be proportional to liquid outflow rate. The 
      passage coefficient, defined as the ratio of particle to liquid outflow rate, was 
      estimated for each particle group by an equation derived from the probability of 
      passage based on FSG and particle size. Particles retained on a 1.18-mm screen were 
      defined as large particles. When the model was evaluated with 41 observations in an 
      independent database, it explained 66% of the variation in observed Kp of forage 
      particles with a root mean square prediction error of 0.009. With 16 observations 
      that also included measurements of liquid passage rate, the model explained 81 and 
      86% of the variation in observed Kp liquid and Kp forage, respectively. An analysis 
      of model predictions using a database with 455 observations indicated that the 
      assumptions underlying the model seemed to be appropriate to describe the dynamics 
      of forage particle flow out of the RR. Sensitivity analysis showed that probability 
      of a particle being in the pool likely to escape is most critical in the passage of 
      large forage particles, whereas the probability of being in the reticulum as well as 
      in the likely to escape pool is important in the passage of small forage and 
      concentrate particles. The FSG of a particle is more important in determining the 
      fate of a particle than its size although they are correlated, especially for forage 
      particles. We conclude that this model can be used to understand the factors that 
      affect the dynamics of particle flow out of the RR and predict Kp of particles out 
      of the RR in dairy cattle.

AB  - The central vestibular system plays an important role in higher neural functions 
      such as self-motion perception and spatial orientation. Its ability to store head 
      angular velocity is called velocity storage mechanism (VSM), which has been 
      thoroughly investigated across a wide range of species. However, little is known 
      about the mouse VSM, because the mouse lacks typical ocular responses such as 
      optokinetic after nystagmus or a dominant time constant of vestibulo-ocular reflex 
      for which the VSM is critical. Experiments were conducted to examine the 
      otolith-driven eye movements related to the VSM and verify its characteristics in 
      mice. We used a novel approach to generate a similar rotating vector as a 
      traditional off-vertical axis rotation (OVAR) but with a larger resultant 
      gravito-inertial force (>1g) by using counter rotation centrifugation. Similar to 
      results previously described in other animals during OVAR, two components of eye 
      movements were induced, i.e. a sinusoidal modulatory eye movement (modulation 
      component) on which a unidirectional nystagmus (bias component) was superimposed. 
      Each response is considered to derive from different mechanisms; modulations arise 
      predominantly through linear vestibulo-ocular reflex, whereas for the bias, the VSM 
      is responsible. Data indicate that the mouse also has a well-developed vestibular 
      system through otoliths inputs, showing its highly conserved nature across mammalian 
      species. On the other hand, to reach a plateau state of bias, a higher frequency 
      rotation or a larger gravito-inertial force was considered to be necessary than 
      other larger animals. Compared with modulation, the bias had a more variable 
      profile, suggesting an inherent complexity of higher-order neural processes in the 
      brain. Our data provide the basis for further study of the central vestibular system 
      in mice, however, the underlying individual variability should be taken into 
      consideration.

      microtissues.

AB  - In a nonadhesive environment, cells will self-assemble into microtissues, a process 
      relevant to tissue engineering. Although this has been recognized for some time, 
      there is no basis for quantitative characterization of this complex process. Here we 
      describe a recently developed assay designed to quantify aspects of the process and 
      discuss its application in comparing behaviors between cell types. Cells were seeded 
      in nonadhesive micromolded wells, each well with a circular trough at its base 
      formed by the cylindrical sidewalls and by a central peg in the form of a right 
      circular cone. Cells settled into the trough and coalesced into a toroid, which was 
      then driven up the conical peg by the forces of self-assembly. The mass of the 
      toroid and its rate of upward movement were used to calculate the cell power 
      expended in the process against gravity. The power of the toroid was found to be 
      0.31 ± 0.01 pJ/h and 4.3 ± 1.7 pJ/h for hepatocyte cells and fibroblasts, 
      respectively. Blocking Rho kinase by means of Y-27632 resulted in a 50% and greater 
      reduction in power expended by each type of toroid, indicating that 
      cytoskeletal-mediated contraction plays a significant role in the self-assembly of 
      both cell types. Whereas the driving force for self-assembly has often been viewed 
      as the binding of surface proteins, these data show that cellular contraction is 
      important for cell-cell adhesion. The power measurement quantifies the contribution 
      of cell contraction, and will be useful for understanding the concerted action of 
      the mechanisms that drive self-assembly.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to quantify how the predicted muscle function would 
      change in a muscle-driven forward simulation of normal walking when changing the 
      number of degrees of freedom in the model. Muscle function was described by 
      individual muscle contributions to the vertical acceleration of the center of mass 
      (COM). We built a two-dimensional (2D) sagittal plane model and a three-dimensional 
      (3D) model in OpenSim and used both models to reproduce the same normal walking 
      data. Perturbation analysis was applied to deduce muscle function in each model. 
      Muscle excitations and contributions to COM support were compared between the 2D and 
      3D models. We found that the 2D model was able to reproduce similar joint kinematics 
      and kinetics patterns as the 3D model. Individual muscle excitations were different 
      for most of the hip muscles but ankle and knee muscles were able to attain similar 
      excitations. Total induced vertical COM acceleration by muscles and gravity was the 
      same for both models. However, individual muscle contributions to COM support 
      varied, especially for hip muscles. Although there is currently no standard way to 
      validate muscle function predictions, a 3D model seems to be more appropriate for 
      estimating individual hip muscle function.

AB  - Open microgroove is one kind of capillary-driven superwicking surface structure. In 
      this study, arrays of parallel V-shaped microgrooves were fabricated on an aluminum 
      surface by using a femtosecond laser to obtain a superwicking surface which can 
      quickly transport the water uphill against gravity. The relationships between the 
      flowing time and flowing distance were investigated and compared with theoretical 
      results. We demonstrated both laser fluence and scanning step size can affect the 
      superwicking performance. The aluminum surfaces fabricated at a laser fluence of 
      18.49 J/cm(2) and 52.67 J/cm(2) showed the best superwicking performances with the 
      average water flow velocities approximately 16.2 mm/s and 16.4 mm/s, respectively, 
      in the distance of 30 mm. On the other hand, the superwicking surfaces show an 
      anisotropic flow characteristic due to the parallel microgrooves structure. However, 
      when the scanning step size drops to 25 µm, the surface will form irregular rough 
      structures that result in the isotropic flow characteristics. Moreover, by using a 
      thermal camera, we found that after a 10 µL water droplet was dropped into the 
      heated surface, the superwicking surface temperature quickly dropped from 92.4 °C to 
      82.5 °C which indicated that laser processing of the superwicking surface has 
      potential application in heat dissipation.

TI  - Cumulative Causation of Rural Migration and Initial Peri-Urbanization in China.
PG  - 6-33
AB  - This paper posits that rural migration feeds the high demand for cheap labor in 
      peri-urbanization, which is driven by globalization, flows of foreign capital, and 
      entrepreneurial local governments. While the gravity model and push/pull perspective 
      ignore the dynamics of migratory course, we use the cumulative causation of 
      migration theory to conceptualize social expectations for outmigration and social 
      resources from migrant networks in destinations. Four major findings are drawn from 
      this demographic analysis based on micro data from China's 2000 Census. First, the 
      expectation of outmigration significantly increases outmigration, and this effect is 
      independent of push factors. Second, foreign direct investment (FDI) contributes to 
      attracting rural labor migrants from other provinces to peri-urban areas as it does 
      to cities. Third, social resources from migrant networks play an important role in 
      attracting rural labor migrants to both city and noncity destinations. Fourth, the 
      importance of wage differentials declines in gravitating rural labor migrants to 
      peri-urban areas. These findings provide tentative evidence that rural labor 
      migration is indispensable during initial peri-urbanization. Infused with flows of 
      FDI and entrepreneurial local governments, rural migration has created a favorable 
      initial condition for peri-urbanization.

TI  - A sensor fusion method for tracking vertical velocity and height based on inertial 
      and barometric altimeter measurements.
PG  - 13324-47
LID - 10.3390/s140813324 [doi]
AB  - A sensor fusion method was developed for vertical channel stabilization by fusing 
      inertial measurements from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and pressure altitude 
      measurements from a barometric altimeter integrated in the same device (baro-IMU). 
      An Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) estimated the quaternion from the sensor frame to 
      the navigation frame; the sensed specific force was rotated into the navigation 
      frame and compensated for gravity, yielding the vertical linear acceleration; 
      finally, a complementary filter driven by the vertical linear acceleration and the 
      measured pressure altitude produced estimates of height and vertical velocity. A 
      method was also developed to condition the measured pressure altitude using a 
      whitening filter, which helped to remove the short-term correlation due to 
      environment-dependent pressure changes from raw pressure altitude. The sensor fusion 
      method was implemented to work on-line using data from a wireless baro-IMU and 
      tested for the capability of tracking low-frequency small-amplitude vertical 
      human-like motions that can be critical for stand-alone inertial sensor 
      measurements. Validation tests were performed in different experimental conditions, 
      namely no motion, free-fall motion, forced circular motion and squatting. Accurate 
      on-line tracking of height and vertical velocity was achieved, giving confidence to 
      the use of the sensor fusion method for tracking typical vertical human motions: 
      velocity Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was in the range 0.04-0.24 m/s; height RMSE 
      was in the range 5-68 cm, with statistically significant performance gains when the 
      whitening filter was used by the sensor fusion method to track relatively 
      high-frequency vertical motions.

TI  - Experimental Demonstration of the Thermochemical Reduction of Ceria in a Solar 
      Aerosol Reactor.
PG  - 10618-10625
AB  - We report on the experimental demonstration of an aerosol solar reactor for the 
      thermal reduction of ceria, as part of a thermochemical redox cycle for splitting 
      H(2)O and CO(2). The concept utilizes a cavity-receiver enclosing an array of 
      alumina tubes, each containing a downward gravity-driven aerosol flow of ceria 
      particles countercurrent to an inert sweep gas flow for intrinsic separation of 
      reduced ceria and oxygen. A 2 kW(th) lab-scale prototype with a single tube was 
      tested under radiative fluxes approaching 4000 suns, yielding reaction extents of up 
      to 53% of the thermodynamic equilibrium at 1919 K within residence times below 1 s. 
      Upon thermal redox cycling, fresh primary particles of 2.44 μm mean size initially 
      formed large agglomerates of 1000 μm mean size, then sintered into stable particles 
      of 150 μm mean size. The reaction extent was primarily limited by heat transfer for 
      large particles/agglomerates (mean size > 200 μm) and by the gas phase advection of 
      product O(2) for smaller particles.

      walking speeds.
PG  - 1450-5
LID - 10.1016/j.jbiomech.2010.02.009 [doi]
AB  - Stiff-knee gait is a common walking problem in cerebral palsy characterized by 
      insufficient knee flexion during swing. To identify factors that may limit knee 
      flexion in swing, it is necessary to understand how unimpaired subjects successfully 
      coordinate muscles and passive dynamics (gravity and velocity-related forces) to 
      accelerate the knee into flexion during double support, a critical phase just prior 
      to swing that establishes the conditions for achieving sufficient knee flexion 
      during swing. It is also necessary to understand how contributions to swing 
      initiation change with walking speed, since patients with stiff-knee gait often walk 
      slowly. We analyzed muscle-driven dynamic simulations of eight unimpaired subjects 
      walking at four speeds to quantify the contributions of muscles, gravity, and 
      velocity-related forces (i.e. Coriolis and centrifugal forces) to preswing knee 
      flexion acceleration during double support at each speed. Analysis of the 
      simulations revealed contributions from muscles and passive dynamics varied 
      systematically with walking speed. Preswing knee flexion acceleration was achieved 
      primarily by hip flexor muscles on the preswing leg with assistance from biceps 
      femoris short head. Hip flexors on the preswing leg were primarily responsible for 
      the increase in preswing knee flexion acceleration during double support with faster 
      walking speed. The hip extensors and abductors on the contralateral leg and 
      velocity-related forces opposed preswing knee flexion acceleration during double 
      support.

TI  - Frequency-selective coding of translation and tilt in macaque cerebellar nodulus and 
      uvula.

AB  - Spatial orientation depends critically on the brain's ability to segregate linear 
      acceleration signals arising from otolith afferents into estimates of self-motion 
      and orientation relative to gravity. In the absence of visual information, this 
      ability is known to deteriorate at low frequencies. The cerebellar nodulus/uvula 
      (NU) has been shown to participate in this computation, although its exact role 
      remains unclear. Here, we show that NU simple spike (SS) responses also exhibit a 
      frequency dependent selectivity to self-motion (translation) and spatial orientation 
      (tilt). At 0.5 Hz, Purkinje cells encode three-dimensional translation and only 
      weakly modulate during pitch and roll tilt (0.4 +/- 0.05 spikes/s/degrees/s). But 
      this ability to selectively signal translation over tilt is compromised at lower 
      frequencies, such that at 0.05 Hz tilt response gains average 2.0 +/- 0.3 
      spikes/s/degrees/s. We show that such frequency-dependent properties are 
      attributable to an incomplete cancellation of otolith-driven SS responses during 
      tilt by a canal-driven signal coding angular position with a sensitivity of 3.9 +/- 
      0.3 spikes/s/degrees. This incomplete cancellation is brought about because 
      otolith-driven SS responses are also partially integrated, thus encoding 
      combinations of linear velocity and acceleration. These results are consistent with 
      the notion that NU SS modulation represents an internal neural representation of 
      similar frequency dependencies seen in behavior.

TI  - Effects of Prone Ventilation on Oxygenation, Inflammation, and Lung Infiltrates in 
      COVID-19 Related Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome: A Retrospective Cohort Study.
LID - 10.3390/jcm9124129 [doi]
LID - 4129
AB  - Patients receiving mechanical ventilation for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
      related, moderate-to-severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (CARDS) have 
      mortality rates between 76-98%. The objective of this retrospective cohort study was 
      to identify differences in prone ventilation effects on oxygenation, pulmonary 
      infiltrates (as observed on chest X-ray (CXR)), and systemic inflammation in CARDS 
      patients by survivorship and to identify baseline characteristics associated with 
      survival after prone ventilation. The study cohort included 23 patients with 
      moderate-to-severe CARDS who received prone ventilation for ≥16 h/day and was 
      segmented by living status: living (n = 6) and deceased (n = 17). Immediately after 
      prone ventilation, PaO(2)/FiO(2) improved by 108% (p < 0.03) for the living and 150% 
      (p < 3 × 10(-4)) for the deceased. However, the 48 h change in lung infiltrate 
      severity in gravity-dependent lung zones was significantly better for the living 
      than for the deceased (p < 0.02). In CXRs of the lower lungs before prone 
      ventilation, we observed 5 patients with confluent infiltrates bilaterally, 12 
      patients with ground-glass opacities (GGOs) bilaterally, and 6 patients with mixed 
      infiltrate patterns; 80% of patients with confluent infiltrates were alive vs. 8% of 
      patients with GGOs. In conclusion, our small study indicates that CXRs may offer 
      clinical utility in selecting patients with moderate-to-severe CARDS who will 
      benefit from prone ventilation. Additionally, our study suggests that lung 
      infiltrate severity may be a better indicator of patient disposition after prone 
      ventilation than PaO(2)/FiO(2).

TI  - Flow induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition, cellular heterogeneity and biomarker 
      modulation in 3D ovarian cancer nodules.
PG  - E1974-83
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1216989110 [doi]
AB  - Seventy-five percent of patients with epithelial ovarian cancer present with 
      advanced-stage disease that is extensively disseminated intraperitoneally and 
      prognosticates the poorest outcomes. Primarily metastatic within the abdominal 
      cavity, ovarian carcinomas initially spread to adjacent organs by direct extension 
      and then disseminate via the transcoelomic route to distant sites. Natural fluidic 
      streams of malignant ascites triggered by physiological factors, including gravity 
      and negative subdiaphragmatic pressure, carry metastatic cells throughout the 
      peritoneum. We investigated the role of fluidic forces as modulators of metastatic 
      cancer biology in a customizable microfluidic platform using 3D ovarian cancer 
      nodules. Changes in the morphological, genetic, and protein profiles of biomarkers 
      associated with aggressive disease were evaluated in the 3D cultures grown under 
      controlled and continuous laminar flow. A modulation of biomarker expression and 
      tumor morphology consistent with increased epithelial-mesenchymal transition, a 
      critical step in metastatic progression and an indicator of aggressive disease, is 
      observed because of hydrodynamic forces. The increase in epithelial-mesenchymal 
      transition is driven in part by a posttranslational up-regulation of epidermal 
      growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression and activation, which is associated with 
      the worst prognosis in ovarian cancer. A flow-induced, transcriptionally regulated 
      decrease in E-cadherin protein expression and a simultaneous increase in vimentin is 
      observed, indicating increased metastatic potential. These findings demonstrate that 
      fluidic streams induce a motile and aggressive tumor phenotype. The microfluidic 
      platform developed here potentially provides a flow-informed framework complementary 
      to conventional mechanism-based therapeutic strategies, with broad applicability to 
      other lethal malignancies.

AB  - Outcomes for neurosurgery patients can be improved by enhancing intraoperative 
      navigation and guidance. Current navigation systems do not accurately account for 
      intraoperative brain deformation. So far, most studies of brain deformation have 
      focused on brain shift, whereas this paper focuses on the brain deformation due to 
      retraction. The heart of our system is a 3D nonrigid registration technique using a 
      biomechanical model driven by the deformations of key surfaces tracked between two 
      intraoperative images. The key surfaces, e.g., the whole-brain region boundary and 
      the lips of the retraction cut, thus deform due to the combination of gravity and 
      retractor deployment. The tissue discontinuity due to retraction is handled via the 
      eXtended Finite Element Method (XFEM), which has the appealing feature of being able 
      to handle arbitrarily shaped discontinuity without any remeshing. Our approach is 
      shown to significantly improve the alignment of intraoperative MRI.

TI  - Capillary Penetration into Inclined Circular Glass Tubes.
PG  - 1289-98
LID - 10.1021/acs.langmuir.5b03904 [doi]
AB  - The spontaneous penetration of a wetting liquid into a vertical tube against the 
      force of gravity and the imbibition of the same liquid into a horizontal tube (or 
      channel) are both driven by capillary forces and described by the same fundamental 
      equations. However, there have been few experimental studies of the transition from 
      one orientation to the other. We report systematic measurements of capillary 
      penetration of polydimethylsiloxane oils of viscosities 9.6, 19.2, and 48.0 mPa·s 
      into glass capillary tubes. We first report the effect of tube radii R between 140 
      and 675 μm on the dynamics of spontaneous imbibition. We show that the data can be 
      fitted using the exact numerical solution to the governing equations and that these 
      are similar to fits using the analytical viscogravitational approximation. However, 
      larger diameter tubes show a rate of penetration slower than expected using an 
      equilibrium contact angle and the known value of liquid viscosity. To account for 
      the slowness, an increase in viscosity by a factor (η/ρ)(scaling) is needed. We show 
      full agreement with theory requires the ratio R/κ(-1) ∼ 0.1 or less, where κ(-1) is 
      the capillary length. In addition, we propose an experimental method that enables 
      the determination of the dynamic contact angle during imbibition, which gives values 
      that agree with the literature values. We then report measurements of dynamic 
      penetration into the tubes of R = 190 and 650 μm for a range of inclination angles 
      to the horizontal, φ, from 5 to 90°. We show that capillary penetration can still be 
      fitted using the viscogravitational solution, rather than the Bosanquet solution 
      which describes imbibition without gravity, even for inclination angles as low as 
      10°. Moreover, at these low angles, the effect of the tube radius is found to 
      diminish and this appears to relate to an effective capillary length, κ(-1)(φ) = 
      (γ(LV)/ρg sin φ)(1/2).

      bottom walls of a separation channel were driven at the same frequency, but with 
      different phases. Changing the phases of the ultrasounds has allowed the formation 
      of a node near the channel wall, and particles are retained in the channel. Two 
      types of particles are separated under an appropriate condition.

AB  - The toilets used most in informal urban settlements have detrimental consequences 
      for the environment and human health due to the lack of proper collection and 
      treatment of toilet waste. Concepts for safe, sustainable and affordable sanitation 
      systems exist, but their feasibility and acceptance have to be investigated at an 
      early stage of development, which is difficult due to the high costs of building 
      working models. In this paper, we present an approach to estimate acceptance in a 
      valid and representative form with only one working model, and apply it to test an 
      innovative zero-emission toilet with recycling of wash water. Four basic principles 
      were specified for investigation and nine hypotheses formulated to test the 
      feasibility and acceptance of these principles: source separation of urine and feces 
      with subsequent collection for resource recovery; provision of wash water in a 
      separate cycle with on-site recovery through a membrane bioreactor; a convenient and 
      attractive overall design; and a financially sustainable business plan. In Kampala 
      (Uganda), in 2013, data was collected from 22 regular users, 308 one-time users and 
      a representative sample of 1538 participants. Qualitative data was collected from 
      the users, who evaluated their likes, perceived benefits, social norms and expected 
      ease of use based on verbal and visual information. Most of the hypotheses were 
      confirmed, indicating the feasibility and acceptance of the basic principles. Source 
      separation and on-site water recovery were found to be feasible and accepted, 
      provided users can be convinced that the emptying service and water recovery process 
      work reliably. In the survey, the toilet was evaluated favorably and 51% of the 
      participants agreed to be placed on a bogus waiting list. However, some design 
      challenges were revealed, such as the size of the toilet, hiding feces from view and 
      improving the separation of urine and water.

TI  - Deciphering the trophic interaction between Akkermansia muciniphila and the 
      butyrogenic gut commensal Anaerostipes caccae using a metatranscriptomic approach.

AB  - Host glycans are paramount in regulating the symbiotic relationship between humans 
      and their gut bacteria. The constant flux of host-secreted mucin at the mucosal 
      layer creates a steady niche for bacterial colonization. Mucin degradation by 
      keystone species subsequently shapes the microbial community. This study 
      investigated the transcriptional response during mucin-driven trophic interaction 
      between the specialised mucin-degrader Akkermansia muciniphila and a butyrogenic gut 
      commensal Anaerostipes caccae. A. muciniphila monocultures and co-cultures with 
      non-mucolytic A. caccae from the Lachnospiraceae family were grown anaerobically in 
      minimal media supplemented with mucin. We analysed for growth, metabolites (HPLC 
      analysis), microbial composition (quantitative reverse transcription PCR), and 
      transcriptional response (RNA-seq). Mucin degradation by A. muciniphila supported 
      the growth of A. caccae and concomitant butyrate production predominantly via the 
      acetyl-CoA pathway. Differential expression analysis (DESeq 2) showed the presence 
      of A. caccae induced changes in the A. muciniphila transcriptional response with 
      increased expression of mucin degradation genes and reduced expression of ribosomal 
      genes. Two putative operons that encode for uncharacterised proteins and an efflux 
      system, and several two-component systems were also differentially regulated. This 
      indicated A. muciniphila changed its transcriptional regulation in response to A. 
      caccae. This study provides insight to understand the mucin-driven microbial ecology 
      using metatranscriptomics. Our findings show that the expression of mucolytic 
      enzymes by A. muciniphila increases upon the presence of a community member. This 
      could indicate its role as a keystone species that supports the microbial community 
      in the mucosal environment by increasing the availability of mucin sugars.

TI  - Passive joint forces are tuned to limb use in insects and drive movements without

AB  - BACKGROUND: Limb movements are generally driven by active muscular contractions 
      working with and against passive forces arising in muscles and other structures. In 
      relatively heavy limbs, the effects of gravity and inertia predominate, whereas in 
      lighter limbs, passive forces intrinsic to the limb are of greater consequence. The 
      roles of passive forces generated by muscles and tendons are well understood, but 
      there has been little recognition that forces originating within joints themselves 
      may also be important, and less still that these joint forces may be adapted through 
      evolution to complement active muscle forces acting at the same joint. RESULTS: We 
      examined the roles of passive joint forces in insect legs with different 
      arrangements of antagonist muscles. We first show that passive forces modify 
      actively generated movements of a joint across its working range, and that they can 
      be sufficiently strong to generate completely passive movements that are faster than 
      active movements observed in natural behaviors. We further demonstrate that some of 
      these forces originate within the joint itself. In legs of different species adapted 
      to different uses (walking, jumping), these passive joint forces complement the 
      balance of strength of the antagonist muscles acting on the joint. We show that 
      passive joint forces are stronger where they assist the weaker of two antagonist 
      muscles. CONCLUSIONS: In limbs where the dictates of a key behavior produce 
      asymmetry in muscle forces, passive joint forces can be coadapted to provide the 
      balance needed for the effective generation of other behaviors.

AB  - Exposure to arsenic (As) in drinking water is a widespread public health problem 
      leading to increased risk for multiple outcomes such as cancer, cardiovascular 
      disease, and possibly renal disease; potential mechanisms include inflammation and 
      oxidative stress. We tested the hypothesis that As exposure is associated with 
      increased inflammation and decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and 
      examined whether the effects of As were modified by plasma glutathione (GSH), 
      glutathione disulfide (GSSG), or the reduction potential of the GSSG/2GSH pair 
      (EhGSH). In a cross-sectional study of N = 374 Bangladeshi adults having a wide 
      range of As exposure, we measured markers of inflammation (plasma C-reactive protein 
      (CRP), α-1 acid glycoprotein (AGP)), renal function (eGFR), GSH, and GSSG. In 
      covariate-adjusted models, a 10% increase in water As, urinary As adjusted for 
      specific gravity (uAs), or blood As (bAs) was associated with a 0.74% (p = 0.01), 
      0.90% (p = 0.16), and 1.39% (p = 0.07) increase in CRP, respectively; there was no 
      association with AGP. A 10% increase in uAs or bAs was associated with an average 
      reduction in eGFR of 0.16 (p = 0.12) and 0.21 ml/min/1.73 m(2) (p = 0.08), 
      respectively. In stratified analyses, the effect of As exposure on CRP was observed 
      only in participants having EhGSH > median (uAs p(Wald) = 0.03; bAs p(Wald) = 0.05). 
      This was primarily driven by stronger effects of As exposure on CRP in participants 
      with lower plasma GSH. The effects of As exposure on eGFR were not modified 
      significantly by EhGSH, GSH, or GSSG. These data suggest that participants having 
      lower plasma GSH and a more oxidized plasma EhGSH are at increased risk for 
      As-induced inflammation. Future studies should evaluate whether antioxidant 
      treatment lowers plasma EhGSH and reduces risk for As-induced diseases.

AB  - Despite prevailing dry conditions, groundwater-fed lakes are found among the earth's 
      tallest sand dunes in the Badain Jaran Desert, China. Indirect evidence suggests 
      that some lakes are shrinking. However, relatively few studies have been carried out 
      to assess the regional groundwater conditions and the fate of the lakes due to the 
      remoteness and severity of the desert environment. Here we use satellite information 
      to demonstrate an ongoing slow decrease in both lake level and groundwater storage. 
      Specifically, we use Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite altimetry data to 
      quantify water levels of the lakes and show overall decreases from 2003 to 2009. We 
      also use water storage changes from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment and 
      simulated soil and water changes from the Global Land Data Assimilation System to 
      demonstrate long-term groundwater depletion in the desert. Rainfall increase driven 
      by climate change has increased soil water and groundwater storage to a certain 
      degree but not enough to compensate for the long-term decline. If countermeasures 
      are not taken to control the pumping, many lakes will continue to shrink, causing an 
      ecological and environmental disaster in the fragile desert oases.

AB  - Background: We aimed to study the contribution of upper limb movements to propulsion 
      during walking in typically developing (TD) children (n = 5) and children with 
      hemiplegic and diplegic cerebral palsy (CP; n = 5 and n = 4, respectively). Methods: 
      Using integrated three-dimensional motion capture data and a scaled generic 
      musculoskeletal model that included upper limbs, we generated torque driven 
      simulations of gait in OpenSim. Induced acceleration analyses were then used to 
      determine the contributions of the individual actuators located at the relevant 
      degrees of freedoms of the upper and lower limb joints to the forward acceleration 
      of the COM at each time point of the gait simulation. The mean values of the 
      contribution of the actuators of upper limbs, lower limbs, and gravity in different 
      phases of the gait cycle were compared between the three groups. Findings: The 
      results indicated a limited contribution of the upper limb actuators to COM forward 
      acceleration compared to the contribution of lower limbs and gravity, in the three 
      groups. In diplegic CP, the contribution of the upper limbs seemed larger compared 
      to TD during the preswing and swing phases of gait. In hemiplegic CP, the unaffected 
      arm seemed to contribute more to COM deceleration during (pre)swing, while the 
      affected side contributed to COM acceleration. Interpretation: These findings 
      suggest that in the presence of lower limb dysfunction, the contribution of the 
      upper limbs to forward propulsion is altered, although they remain negligible 
      compared to the lower limbs and gravity.

TI  - Integration of metabolome data with metabolic networks reveals reporter reactions.
PG  - 50
AB  - Interpreting quantitative metabolome data is a difficult task owing to the high 
      connectivity in metabolic networks and inherent interdependency between enzymatic 
      regulation, metabolite levels and fluxes. Here we present a hypothesis-driven 
      algorithm for the integration of such data with metabolic network topology. The 
      algorithm thus enables identification of reporter reactions, which are reactions 
      where there are significant coordinated changes in the level of surrounding 
      metabolites following environmental/genetic perturbations. Applicability of the 
      algorithm is demonstrated by using data from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The algorithm 
      includes preprocessing of a genome-scale yeast model such that the fraction of 
      measured metabolites within the model is enhanced, and thus it is possible to map 
      significant alterations associated with a perturbation even though a small fraction 
      of the complete metabolome is measured. By combining the results with transcriptome 
      data, we further show that it is possible to infer whether the reactions are 
      hierarchically or metabolically regulated. Hereby, the reported approach represents 
      an attempt to map different layers of regulation within metabolic networks through 
      combination of metabolome and transcriptome data.

TI  - Passive resting state and history of antagonist muscle activity shape active 
      extensions in an insect limb.
PG  - 2756-68
LID - 10.1152/jn.01072.2011 [doi]
AB  - Limb movements can be driven by muscle contractions, external forces, or intrinsic 
      passive forces. For lightweight limbs like those of insects or small vertebrates, 
      passive forces can be large enough to overcome the effects of gravity and may even 
      generate limb movements in the absence of active muscle contractions. Understanding 
      the sources and actions of such forces is therefore important in understanding motor 
      control. We describe passive properties of the femur-tibia joint of the locust hind 
      leg. The resting angle is determined primarily by passive properties of the 
      relatively large extensor tibiae muscle and is influenced by the history of 
      activation of the fast extensor tibiae motor neuron. The resting angle is therefore 
      better described as a history-dependent resting state. We selectively stimulated 
      different flexor tibiae motor neurons to generate a range of isometric contractions 
      of the flexor tibiae muscle and then stimulated the fast extensor tibiae motor 
      neuron to elicit active tibial extensions. Residual forces in the flexor muscle have 
      only a small effect on subsequent active extensions, but the effect is larger for 
      distal than for proximal flexor motor neurons and varies with the strength of flexor 
      activation. We conclude that passive properties of a lightweight limb make 
      substantial and complex contributions to the resting state of the limb that must be 
      taken into account in the patterning of neuronal control signals driving its active 
      movements. Low variability in the effects of the passive forces may permit the 
      nervous system to accurately predict their contributions to behavior.

TI  - Canal and otolith contributions to compensatory tilt responses in pigeons.
PG  - 1488-97
LID - 10.1152/jn.90257.2008 [doi]
AB  - Gaze-stabilizing eye and head responses compensate more effectively for 
      low-frequency rotational motion when such motion stimulates the otolith organs, as 
      during earth-horizontal axis rotations. However, the nature of the otolith signal 
      responsible for this improvement in performance has not been previously determined. 
      In this study, we used combinations of earth-horizontal axis rotational and 
      translational motion to manipulate the magnitude of net linear acceleration 
      experienced by pigeons, under both head-fixed and head-free conditions. We show that 
      phase enhancement of eye and head responses to low-frequency rotational motion was 
      causally related to the magnitude of dynamic net linear acceleration and not the 
      gravitational acceleration component. We also show that canal-driven and 
      otolith-driven eye responses were both spatially and temporally appropriate to 
      combine linearly, and that a simple linear model combining canal- and otolith-driven 
      components predicted eye responses to complex motion that were consistent with our 
      experimental observations. However, the same model did not predict the observed head 
      responses, which were spatially but not temporally appropriate to combine according 
      to the same linear scheme. These results suggest that distinct vestibular processing 
      substrates exist for eye and head responses in pigeons and that these are likely 
      different from the vestibular processing substrates observed in primates.

TI  - Experimental investigation of the initial regime in fingering electrodeposition: 
      dispersion relation and velocity measurements.
PG  - 041607
AB  - Recently a fingering morphology, resembling the hydrodynamic Saffman-Taylor 
      instability, was identified in the quasi-two-dimensional electrodeposition of 
      copper. We present here measurements of the dispersion relation of the growing 
      front. The instability is accompanied by gravity-driven convection rolls at the 
      electrodes, which are examined using particle image velocimetry. While at the anode 
      the theory presented by Chazalviel et al. [J. Electroanal. Chem. 407, 61 (1996)] 
      describes the convection roll, the flow field at the cathode is more complicated 
      because of the growing deposit. In particular, the analysis of the orientation of 
      the velocity vectors reveals some lag of the development of the convection roll 
      compared to the finger envelope.

TI  - Hypergravity within a critical period impacts on the maturation of somatosensory 
      cortical maps and their potential for use-dependent plasticity in the adult.
PG  - 2740-60
LID - 10.1152/jn.00900.2015 [doi]
AB  - We investigated experience-dependent plasticity of somatosensory maps in rat S1 
      cortex during early development. We analyzed both short- and long-term effects of 
      exposure to 2G hypergravity (HG) during the first 3 postnatal weeks on forepaw 
      representations. We also examined the potential of adult somatosensory maps for 
      experience-dependent plasticity after early HG rearing. At postnatal day 22, HG was 
      found to induce an enlargement of cortical zones driven by nail displacements and a 
      contraction of skin sectors of the forepaw map. In these remaining zones serving the 
      skin, neurons displayed expanded glabrous skin receptive fields (RFs). HG also 
      induced a bias in the directional sensitivity of neuronal responses to nail 
      displacement. HG-induced map changes were still found after 16 wk of housing in 
      normogravity (NG). However, the glabrous skin RFs recorded in HG rats decreased to 
      values similar to that of NG rats, as early as the end of the first week of housing 
      in NG. Moreover, the expansion of the glabrous skin area and decrease in RF size 
      normally induced in adults by an enriched environment (EE) did not occur in the HG 
      rats, even after 16 wk of EE housing in NG. Our findings reveal that early postnatal 
      experience critically and durably shapes S1 forepaw maps and limits their potential 
      to be modified by novel experience in adulthood.

TI  - Relationship between complex and simple spike activity in macaque caudal vermis 
      during three-dimensional vestibular stimulation.
PG  - 8111-26
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5779-09.2010 [doi]
AB  - Lobules 10 and 9 in the caudal posterior vermis [also known as nodulus and uvula 
      (NU)] are thought important for spatial orientation and balance. Here, we 
      characterize complex spike (CS) and simple spike (SS) activity in response to 
      three-dimensional vestibular stimulation. The strongest modulation was seen during 
      translation (CS: 12.8 +/- 1.5, SS: 287.0 +/- 23.2 spikes/s/G, 0.5 Hz). Preferred 
      directions tended to cluster along the cardinal axes (lateral, fore-aft, vertical) 
      for CSs and along the semicircular canal axes for SSs. Most notably, the preferred 
      directions for CS/SS pairs arising from the same Purkinje cells were rarely aligned. 
      During 0.5 Hz pitch/roll tilt, only about a third of CSs had significant modulation. 
      Thus, most CSs correlated best with inertial rather than net linear acceleration. By 
      comparison, all SSs were selective for translation and ignored changes in spatial 
      orientation relative to gravity. Like SSs, tilt modulation of CSs increased at lower 
      frequencies. CSs and SSs had similar response dynamics, responding to linear 
      velocity during translation and angular position during tilt. The most salient 
      finding is that CSs did not always modulate out-of-phase with SSs. The CS/SS phase 
      difference varied broadly among Purkinje cells, yet for each cell it was precisely 
      matched for the otolith-driven and canal-driven components of the response. These 
      findings illustrate a spatiotemporal mismatch between CS/SS pairs and provide the 
      first comprehensive description of the macaque NU, an important step toward 
      understanding how CSs and SSs interact during complex movements and spatial 
      disorientation.

TI  - Heating of Jupiter's upper atmosphere above the Great Red Spot.
PG  - 190-2
AB  - The temperatures of giant-planet upper atmospheres at mid- to low latitudes are 
      measured to be hundreds of degrees warmer than simulations based on solar heating 
      alone can explain. Modelling studies that focus on additional sources of heating 
      have been unable to resolve this major discrepancy. Equatorward transport of energy 
      from the hot auroral regions was expected to heat the low latitudes, but models have 
      demonstrated that auroral energy is trapped at high latitudes, a consequence of the 
      strong Coriolis forces on rapidly rotating planets. Wave heating, driven from below, 
      represents another potential source of upper-atmospheric heating, though initial 
      calculations have proven inconclusive for Jupiter, largely owing to a lack of 
      observational constraints on wave parameters. Here we report that the upper 
      atmosphere above Jupiter's Great Red Spot--the largest storm in the Solar System--is 
      hundreds of degrees hotter than anywhere else on the planet. This hotspot, by 
      process of elimination, must be heated from below, and this detection is therefore 
      strong evidence for coupling between Jupiter's lower and upper atmospheres, probably 
      the result of upwardly propagating acoustic or gravity waves.

TI  - Patterning behavior of gravitationally modulated supercritical Marangoni flow in 
      liquid layers.
PG  - 053107
LID - 10.1103/PhysRevE.93.053107 [doi]
AB  - The objective of the present analysis is the investigation of hybrid convection 
      induced by the joint influence of imposed vibrations (g-jitters) of desired 
      amplitude and frequency and surface-tension-induced forces in a nonisothermal liquid 
      layer. This study may be regarded as the natural extension of an earlier work [V. M. 
      Shevtsova, I. Nepomnyashchy, and J. C. Legros, Phys. Rev. E 67, 066308 
      (2003)10.1103/PhysRevE.67.066308], where the focus was on convection driven by 
      interacting thermocapillarity and steady gravity. As in that work, conditions are 
      considered for which the unperturbed (vibrationless) Marangoni flow would be 
      characterized by the emergence and propagation of a classical hydrothermal wave, 
      namely, a supercritical thermofluidynamic disturbance propagating continuously in 
      the upstream direction. A number of numerical results are analyzed and discussed. 
      Regimes of quasistationary rolls, standing waves, traveling waves, and modulated 
      (pulsotraveling) disturbances are identified in the considered space of parameters. 
      Most interestingly, it is observed that traveling waves can reverse their direction 
      of propagation in some specific regions of the phase space.

TI  - Astrobiological aspects of Mars and human presence: pros and cons.
PG  - 49-52
AB  - After the realization of the International Space Station, human exploratory missions 
      to Moon or Mars, i.e. beyond low Earth orbit, are widely considered as the next 
      logical step of peaceful cooperation in space on a global scale. Besides the human 
      desire to extend the window of habitability, human exploratory missions are driven 
      by several aspects of science, technology, culture and economy. Mars is currently 
      considered as a major target in the search for life beyond the Earth. Understanding 
      the history of water on Mars appears to be one of the clues to the puzzle on the 
      probability of life on Mars. On Earth microorganisms have flourished for more than 
      3.5 Ga and have developed strategies to cope with so-called extreme conditions 
      (e.g., hot vents, permafrost, subsurface regions, rocks or salt crystals). 
      Therefore, in search for life on Mars, microorganisms are the most likely candidates 
      for a putative biota on Mars and the search for morphological or chemical signatures 
      of life or its relics is one of the primary and most exciting goals of Mars 
      exploration. The presence of humans on the surface of Mars will substantially 
      increase this research potential, e.g., by supporting deep subsurface drilling and 
      by allowing intellectual collection and sophisticated in situ analysis of samples of 
      astrobiological interest. On the other hand, such long-duration missions beyond LEO 
      will add a new dimension to human space flight, concerning the distance of travel, 
      the radiation environment, the gravity levels, the duration of the mission, and the 
      level of confinement and isolation the crew will be exposed to. This will raise the 
      significance of several health issues, above all radiation protection, gravity 
      related effects as well as psychological issues. Furthermore, the import of internal 
      and external microorganisms inevitably accompanying any human mission to Mars, or 
      brought purposely to Mars as part of a bioregenerative life support system needs 
      careful consideration with regard to planetary protection issues. Therefore, before 
      planning any human exploratory mission, the critical issues concerning human health 
      and wellbeing as well as protection of Mars in its pristine condition need to be 
      investigated.

TI  - Cross-helicity in rotating homogeneous shear-stratified turbulence.
PG  - 114501
AB  - We consider homogeneous shear-stratified turbulence in a rotating frame, that 
      exhibits complex nonlinear dynamics. Since the analysis of relative orientation 
      between coupled fluctuating fields helps us to understand turbulence dynamics, we 
      focus on the alignment properties of both the velocity and gravity fields with the 
      potential vorticity gradient. With the help of statistical mechanics, we define a 
      vector field which plays a role in the analogous so-called cross-helicity in 
      magnetohydrodynamics. High-resolution direct numerical simulations of developed 
      homogeneous baroclinic turbulence are performed, and a detailed analysis of 
      probability density functions for cross-helicity is provided. A net preference for 
      positive cross-helicity is shown to be related to a new alignment mechanism. We 
      argue that the analysis of cross-helicity is crucial for understanding the dynamics 
      of buoyancy driven flows.

TI  - Segregation induced by inelasticity in a vibrofluidized granular mixture.
PG  - 061301
AB  - We investigate the segregation of a dense binary mixture of granular particles that 
      only differ in their restitution coefficient. The mixture is vertically vibrated in 
      the presence of gravity. We find a partial segregation of the species, where most 
      dissipative particles submerge in the less dissipative ones. The segregation occurs 
      even if one type of the particles is elastic. In order to have a complete 
      description of the system, we study the structure of the fluid at microscopic scale 
      (few particle diameters). The density and temperature pair distribution functions 
      show strong enhancements with respect to the equilibrium ones at the same density. 
      In particular, there is an increase in the probability that the more inelastic 
      particles group together in pairs (microsegregation). Microscopically the 
      segregation is buoyancy driven, by the appearance of a dense and cold region around 
      the more inelastic particles.

TI  - Dietary restriction alters demographic but not behavioral aging in Drosophila.
PG  - 631-7
AB  - Dietary restriction extends lifespan substantially in numerous species including 
      Drosophila. However, it is unclear whether dietary restriction in flies impacts 
      age-related functional declines in conjunction with its effects on lifespan. Here, 
      we address this issue by assessing the effect of dietary restriction on lifespan and 
      behavioral senescence in two wild-type strains, in our standard white laboratory 
      stock, and in short-lived flies with reduced expression of superoxide dismutase 2. 
      As expected, dietary restriction extended lifespan in all of these strains. The 
      effect of dietary restriction on lifespan varied with genetic background, ranging 
      from 40 to 90% extension of median lifespan in the seven strains tested. 
      Interestingly, despite its robust positive effects on lifespan, dietary restriction 
      had no substantive effects on senescence of behavior in any of the strains in our 
      studies. Our results suggest that dietary restriction does not have a global impact 
      on aging in Drosophila and support the hypothesis that lifespan and behavioral 
      senescence are not driven by identical mechanisms.

TI  - Pretransitional effects in dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine vesicle membranes: optical 
      dynamometry study.
PG  - 340-56
AB  - We used micron-sized latex spheres to probe the phase state and the viscoelastic 
      properties of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) bilayers as a function of 
      temperature. One or two particles were manipulated and stuck to a DMPC giant vesicle 
      by means of an optical trap. Above the fluid-gel main transition temperature, T(m) 
      congruent with 23.4 degrees C, the particles could move on the surface of the 
      vesicle, spontaneously (Brownian motion) or driven by an external force, either 
      gravity or the laser beam's radiation pressure. From the analysis of the particle 
      motions, we deduced the values of the membrane hydrodynamic shear viscosity, eta(s), 
      and found that it would increase considerably near T(m). Below T(m), the 
      long-distance motion of the particles was blocked. We performed experiments with two 
      particles stuck on the membrane. By optical dynamometry, we measured the elastic 
      resistance of the membrane to a variation in the interparticle distance and found 
      that it would decrease considerably (down to zero) when the temperature was 
      increased to T(m). We propose an interpretation relating the elastic response to the 
      membrane curvature modulus, k(C). In this scheme, the two-bead dynamometry 
      experiments provide a direct measurement of k(C) in the P'(beta) phase of lipid 
      bilayers.

TI  - Comparison of the tolerability of recombinant human hyaluronidase + normal saline 
      and recombinant human hyaluronidase + lactated ringer's solution administered 
      subcutaneously: A phase IV, double-blind, randomized pilot study in healthy 
      volunteers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) (150 U) is approved by the US 
      Food and Drug Administration to facilitate subcutaneous fluid administration in 
      adults and children. OBJECTIVE: This Phase IV, double-blind, randomized pilot study 
      was designed to compare the tolerability, flow rate, and safety profile of 
      subcutaneous infusions of normal saline (NS) and lactated Ringer's (LR) solutions 
      following subcutaneous administration of rHuPH20. METHODS: Healthy volunteers 
      received 1 mL rHuPH20 (150 U) in each thigh, followed by simultaneous gravity-driven 
      subcutaneous infusions of 500 mL of LR solution into 1 thigh and NS solution into 
      the contralateral thigh. Subjects rated infusion-site discomfort in each thigh using 
      a 100-mm (0 = no pain to 100 = most severe pain) visual analog scale (VAS) at 
      baseline (ie, after catheter placement/ rHuPH20 injection and just prior to the 
      start of the infusions) and at the following times: after infusion of 250 mL, after 
      infusion of 500 mL (end of infusion), and when thigh circumference returned to 
      within 5% of baseline. Adverse events (AEs) were recorded throughout the study. The 
      primary tolerability end point was the maximal increase from baseline in 
      infusion-site discomfort on the VAS. Secondary end points included infusion flow 
      rate, change in thigh circumference, subject preference for leftversus right-thigh 
      infusion, and safety profile measures. RESULTS: Fifteen subjects (14 women, 1 man; 
      mean age, 41 years [range, 20-60 years]) were included in the study. Mean (SD) 
      maximal increase from baseline VAS pain score was significantly greater with NS 
      solution than with LR solution (20.0 [19.4] vs 9.4 [18.3] mm, respectively; P = 
      0.005). Mean infusion flow rate was not significantly different between the NS and 
      LR solutions (384.1 [118.1] vs 395.8 [132.8] mL/h). No significant differences 
      between solutions were observed in mean maximal change in thigh circumference (5.2% 
      [1.6%] vs 5.3% [1.5%]). All subjects expressed global preference for LR infusion 
      over NS infusion. All subjects experienced ≥1 AE; the majority of AEs were mild, 
      localized infusion-site reactions. Of all AEs (regardless of their relationship to 
      study drug or procedure), 81% were mild injectionsite reactions that were similar in 
      nature for the NS and LR solutions. Although the types of mild local AEs were 
      similar for the 2 infusions, they were numerically more common with NS infusions (15 
      subjects [100%]) than with LR infusions (9 subjects [60%]). For the NS and LR 
      solutions, the most frequent infusion-site AEs were pain (67% vs 40%, respectively), 
      erythema (47% vs 13%), and irritation (27% vs 20%). CONCLUSIONS: This small pilot 
      study found that the mean maximal increase from baseline in self-assessed pain VAS 
      scores was statistically significantly higher with NS solution than LR solution. In 
      addition, all subjects preferred LR solution to NS solution, and the incidence of 
      some infusion-site AEs was numerically greater with NS solution. Although the VAS 
      score indicated a statistically significant difference in tolerability favoring LR, 
      the modest changes from baseline suggest both solutions were generally well 
      tolerated and support the use of both NS and LR, as appropriate, for 
      rHuPH20-facilitated subcutaneous isotonic fluid infusion in healthy adults. These 
      results need to be confirmed in larger, controlled clinical studies.

TI  - Adhesive interactions between vesicles in the strong adhesion limit.
PG  - 59-73
LID - 10.1021/la1023168 [doi]
AB  - We consider the adhesive interaction energy between a pair of vesicles in the strong 
      adhesion limit, in which bending forces play a negligible role in determining 
      vesicle shape compared to forces due to membrane stretching. Although force−distance 
      or energy−distance relationships characterizing adhesive interactions between fluid 
      bilayers are routinely measured using the surface forces apparatus, the atomic force 
      microscope, and the biomembrane force probe, the interacting bilayers in these 
      methods are supported on surfaces (e.g., mica sheet) and cannot be deformed. 
      However, it is known that, in a suspension, vesicles composed of the same bilayer 
      can deform by stretching or bending, and can also undergo changes in volume. 
      Adhesively interacting vesicles can thus form flat regions in the contact zone, 
      which will result in an enhanced interaction energy as compared to rigid vesicles. 
      The focus of this paper is to examine the magnitude of the interaction energy 
      between adhesively interacting, deformed vesicles relative to free, undeformed 
      vesicles as a function of the intervesicle separation. The modification of the 
      intervesicle interaction energy due to vesicle deformability can be calculated 
      knowing the undeformed radius of the vesicles, R0, the bending modulus, k(b), the 
      area expansion modulus, k(a), and the adhesive minimum, W(P)(0), and separation, 
      D(P)(0), in the energy of interaction between two flat bilayers, which can be 
      obtained from the force−distance measurements made using the above supported-bilayer 
      methods. For vesicles with constant volumes, we show that adhesive potentials 
      between nondeforming bilayers such as |W(P)(0)| 5 × 10(−4) mJ/m2, which are 
      ordinarily considered weak in the colloidal physics literature, can result in 
      significantly deep (>10×) energy minima due to increase in vesicle area and 
      flattening in the contact region. If the osmotic expulsion of water across the 
      vesicles driven by the tense, stretched membrane in the presence of an osmotically 
      active solute is also taken into account, the vesicles can undergo additional 
      deformation (flattening), which further enhances the adhesive interaction between 
      them. Finally, equilibration of ions and solutes due to the concentration 
      differences created by the osmotic exchange of water can lead to further enhancement 
      of the adhesion energy. Our result of the progressively increasing adhesive 
      interaction energy between vesicles in the above regimes could explain why 
      suspensions of very weakly attractive vesicles may undergo flocculation and eventual 
      instability due to separation of vesicles from the suspending fluid by gravity. The 
      possibility of such an instability is an extremely important issue for concentrated 
      vesicle-based products and applications such as fabric softeners, hair therapeutics 
      and drug delivery.

TI  - Mass transport of impurities in a moderately dense granular gas.
PG  - 041303
AB  - Transport coefficients associated with the mass flux of impurities immersed in a 
      moderately dense granular gas of hard disks or spheres described by the inelastic 
      Enskog equation are obtained by means of the Chapman-Enskog expansion. The transport 
      coefficients are determined as the solutions of a set of coupled linear integral 
      equations recently derived for polydisperse granular mixtures [Garzó, Phys. Rev. E 
      76, 031304 (2007)]. With the objective of obtaining theoretical expressions for the 
      transport coefficients that are sufficiently accurate for highly inelastic 
      collisions, we solve the above integral equations by using the second Sonine 
      approximation. As a complementary route, we numerically solve by means of the direct 
      simulation Monte Carlo method (DSMC) the inelastic Enskog equation to get the 
      kinetic diffusion coefficient D0 for two and three dimensions. We have observed in 
      all our simulations that the disagreement, for arbitrarily large inelasticity, in 
      the values of both solutions (DSMC and second Sonine approximation) is less than 4%. 
      Moreover, we show that the second Sonine approximation to D0 yields a dramatic 
      improvement (up to 50%) over the first Sonine approximation for impurity particles 
      lighter than the surrounding gas and in the range of large inelasticity. The results 
      reported in this paper are of direct application in important problems in granular 
      flows, such as segregation driven by gravity and a thermal gradient. We analyze here 
      the segregation criteria that result from our theoretical expressions of the 
      transport coefficients.

TI  - Visual gaze control during peering flight manoeuvres in honeybees.
PG  - 1209-17
LID - 10.1098/rspb.2009.1928 [doi]
AB  - As animals travel through the environment, powerful reflexes help stabilize their 
      gaze by actively maintaining head and eyes in a level orientation. Gaze 
      stabilization reduces motion blur and prevents image rotations. It also assists in 
      depth perception based on translational optic flow. Here we describe side-to-side 
      flight manoeuvres in honeybees and investigate how the bees' gaze is stabilized 
      against rotations during these movements. We used high-speed video equipment to 
      record flight paths and head movements in honeybees visiting a feeder. We show that 
      during their approach, bees generate lateral movements with a median amplitude of 
      about 20 mm. These movements occur with a frequency of up to 7 Hz and are generated 
      by periodic roll movements of the thorax with amplitudes of up to + or - 60 degrees 
      . During such thorax roll oscillations, the head is held close to horizontal, 
      thereby minimizing rotational optic flow. By having bees fly through an oscillating, 
      patterned drum, we show that head stabilization is based mainly on visual motion 
      cues. Bees exposed to a continuously rotating drum, however, hold their head fixed 
      at an oblique angle. This result shows that although gaze stabilization is driven by 
      visual motion cues, it is limited by other mechanisms, such as the dorsal light 
      response or gravity reception.

TI  - Escape of the martian protoatmosphere and initial water inventory.
PG  - 106-119
AB  - Latest research in planet formation indicates that Mars formed within a few million 
      years (Myr) and remained as a planetary embryo that never grew to a more massive 
      planet. It can also be expected from dynamical models that most of Mars' building 
      blocks consisted of material that formed in orbital locations just beyond the ice 
      line which could have contained [Formula: see text] of H(2)O. By using these 
      constraints, we estimate the nebula-captured and catastrophically outgassed volatile 
      contents during the solidification of Mars' magma ocean and apply a hydrodynamic 
      upper atmosphere model for the study of the soft X-ray and extreme ultraviolet (XUV) 
      driven thermal escape of the martian protoatmosphere during the early active epoch 
      of the young Sun. The amount of gas that has been captured from the protoplanetary 
      disk into the planetary atmosphere is calculated by solving the hydrostatic 
      structure equations in the protoplanetary nebula. Depending on nebular properties 
      such as the dust grain depletion factor, planetesimal accretion rates and 
      luminosities, hydrogen envelopes with masses [Formula: see text] to [Formula: see 
      text] could have been captured from the nebula around early Mars. Depending on the 
      before mentioned parameters, due to the planets low gravity and a solar XUV flux 
      that was [Formula: see text] times stronger compared to the present value, our 
      results indicate that early Mars would have lost its nebular captured hydrogen 
      envelope after the nebula gas evaporated, during a fast period of [Formula: see 
      text]. After the solidification of early Mars' magma ocean, catastrophically 
      outgassed volatiles with the amount of [Formula: see text] H(2)O and [Formula: see 
      text] CO(2) could have been lost during [Formula: see text], if the impact related 
      energy flux of large planetesimals and small embryos to the planet's surface lasted 
      long enough, that the steam atmosphere could have been prevented from condensing. If 
      this was not the case, then our results suggest that the timescales for H(2)O 
      condensation and ocean formation may have been shorter compared to the atmosphere 
      evaporation timescale, so that one can speculate that sporadically periods, where 
      some amount of liquid water may have been present on the planet's surface. However, 
      depending on the amount of the outgassed volatiles, because of impacts and the high 
      XUV-driven atmospheric escape rates, such sporadically wet surface conditions may 
      have also not lasted much longer than [Formula: see text]. After the loss of the 
      captured hydrogen envelope and outgassed volatiles during the first 100 Myr period 
      of the young Sun, a warmer and probably wetter period may have evolved by a 
      combination of volcanic outgassing and impact delivered volatiles [Formula: see 
      text] ago, when the solar XUV flux decreased to values that have been [Formula: see 
      text] times that of today's Sun.

TI  - Suppressing star formation in quiescent galaxies with supermassive black hole winds.
PG  - 504-8
LID - 10.1038/nature18006 [doi]
AB  - Quiescent galaxies with little or no ongoing star formation dominate the population 
      of galaxies with masses above 2 × 10(10) times that of the Sun; the number of 
      quiescent galaxies has increased by a factor of about 25 over the past ten billion 
      years (refs 1-4). Once star formation has been shut down, perhaps during the quasar 
      phase of rapid accretion onto a supermassive black hole, an unknown mechanism must 
      remove or heat the gas that is subsequently accreted from either stellar mass loss 
      or mergers and that would otherwise cool to form stars. Energy output from a black 
      hole accreting at a low rate has been proposed, but observational evidence for this 
      in the form of expanding hot gas shells is indirect and limited to radio galaxies at 
      the centres of clusters, which are too rare to explain the vast majority of the 
      quiescent population. Here we report bisymmetric emission features co-aligned with 
      strong ionized-gas velocity gradients from which we infer the presence of centrally 
      driven winds in typical quiescent galaxies that host low-luminosity active nuclei. 
      These galaxies are surprisingly common, accounting for as much as ten per cent of 
      the quiescent population with masses around 2 × 10(10) times that of the Sun. In a 
      prototypical example, we calculate that the energy input from the galaxy's low-level 
      active supermassive black hole is capable of driving the observed wind, which 
      contains sufficient mechanical energy to heat ambient, cooler gas (also detected) 
      and thereby suppress star formation.

AB  - Disagreements across different reanalyses over South Asia result into uncertainty in 
      assessment of water availability, which is computed as the difference between 
      Precipitation and Evapotranspiration (P-E). Here, we compute P-E directly from 
      atmospheric budget with divergence of moisture flux for different reanalyses and 
      find improved correlation with observed values of P-E, acquired from station and 
      satellite data. We also find reduced closure terms for water cycle computed with 
      atmospheric budget, analysed over South Asian landmass, when compared to that 
      obtained with individual values of P and E. The P-E value derived with atmospheric 
      budget is more consistent with energy budget, when we use top-of-atmosphere 
      radiation for the same. For analysing water cycle, we use runoff from Global Land 
      Data Assimilation System, and water storage from Gravity Recovery and Climate 
      Experiment. We find improvements in agreements across different reanalyses, in terms 
      of inter-annual cross correlation when atmospheric budget is used to estimate P-E 
      and hence, emphasize to use the same for estimations of water availability in South 
      Asia to reduce uncertainty. Our results on water availability with reduced 
      uncertainty over highly populated monsoon driven South Asia will be useful for water 
      management and agricultural decision making.

TI  - A semiquantitative analysis of the dynamics of a Goldman-type vaporiser.
PG  - 557-70
AB  - When a turbulent flow of a carrier gas is passed over a liquid anaesthetic agent 
      contained in a vaporiser of Goldman design, evaporation from the cooled surface 
      leads rapidly to a succession of fluid instabilities which set in at characteristic 
      critical conditions. An initially quiescent boundary layer at the surface is 
      sequentially replaced by a thin layer of toroidal (Bénard-Marangoni) convection 
      cells which are driven by surface tension gradients. These are then augmented by 
      Rayleigh-Bénard convection driven by gravity, the whole process terminating in 
      intermittent columnar plunging of cold fluid from a chaotic surface layer of 
      pulsating thickness to the base of the liquid pool. Residual striations from these 
      plunging columns persist throughout the bulk of the liquid so long as evaporation 
      continues. The ultimate state is then one in which turbulence occurs throughout both 
      liquid and vapour phases. In this paper, a semiquantitative analysis of the system 
      dynamics is given with supportive experimental evidence where possible.

PG  - 1344-9
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1405713112 [doi]
AB  - Localized adverse events, including natural hazards, epidemiological events, and 
      human conflict, underscore the criticality of quantifying and mapping current 
      population. Building on the spatial interpolation technique previously developed for 
      high-resolution population distribution data (LandScan Global and LandScan USA), we 
      have constructed an empirically informed spatial distribution of projected 
      population of the contiguous United States for 2030 and 2050, depicting one of many 
      possible population futures. Whereas most current large-scale, spatially explicit 
      population projections typically rely on a population gravity model to determine 
      areas of future growth, our projection model departs from these by accounting for 
      multiple components that affect population distribution. Modeled variables, which 
      included land cover, slope, distances to larger cities, and a moving average of 
      current population, were locally adaptive and geographically varying. The resulting 
      weighted surface was used to determine which areas had the greatest likelihood for 
      future population change. Population projections of county level numbers were 
      developed using a modified version of the US Census's projection methodology, with 
      the US Census's official projection as the benchmark. Applications of our model 
      include incorporating multiple various scenario-driven events to produce a range of 
      spatially explicit population futures for suitability modeling, service area 
      planning for governmental agencies, consequence assessment, mitigation planning and 
      implementation, and assessment of spatially vulnerable populations.

PG  - 505-11
LID - 10.1016/j.jcis.2011.08.046 [doi]
AB  - The influence of salt concentration on the terminal velocities of gravity-driven 
      single bubbles sliding along an inclined glass wall has been investigated, in an 
      effort to establish whether surface forces acting between the wall and the bubble 
      influence the latter's mobility. A simple sliding bubble apparatus was employed to 
      measure the terminal velocities of air bubbles with radii ranging from 0.3 to 1.5 mm 
      sliding along the interior wall of an inclined Pyrex glass cylinder with inclination 
      angles between 0.6 and 40.1°. Experiments were performed in pure water, 10 mM and 
      100 mM KCl solutions. We compared our experimental results with a theory by Hodges 
      et al. which considers hydrodynamic forces only, and with a theory developed by two 
      of us which considers surface forces to play a significant role. Our experimental 
      results demonstrate that the terminal velocity of the bubble not only varies with 
      the angle of inclination and the bubble size but also with the salt concentration, 
      particularly at low inclination angles of ∼1-5°, indicating that double-layer forces 
      between the bubble and the wall influence the sliding behavior. This is the first 
      demonstration that terminal velocities of sliding bubbles are affected by disjoining 
      pressure.

TI  - Bone formation induced by a novel form of mechanical loading on joint tissue.
PG  - 41-4
AB  - Because of insufficient mechanical loading, exposure to weightlessness in space 
      flight reduces bone mass. In order to maintain bone mass in a weightless condition, 
      we investigated a novel form of mechanical loading--joint loading. Since some part 
      of gravity-induced loading to our skeletal system is absorbed by viscoelastic 
      deformation of joint tissues, we hypothesized that deformation of joint tissues 
      would generate fluid flow in bone and stimulate bone formation in diaphyseal 
      cortical bone. In order to test the hypothesis, we applied directly oscillatory 
      loading to an elbow joint of mice and conducted bone histomorphometry on the 
      diaphysis of ulnae. Using murine femurs ex vivo, streaming potentials were measured 
      to evaluate a fluid flow induced by joint loading. Bone histomorphometry revealed 
      that compared to no loading control, elbow loading increased mineralizing surface, 
      mineral apposition rate, and bone formation rate 3.2-fold, 3.0-fold, and 7.9-fold, 
      respectively. We demonstrated that joint loading generated a streaming potential in 
      a medullar cavity of femurs. The results support a novel mechanism, in which joint 
      loading stimulates effectively bone formation possibly by generating fluid flow, and 
      suggest that a supportive attachment to joints, driven passively or actively, would 
      be useful to maintain bone mass of astronauts during an exposure to weightlessness.

TI  - Self-assembly of microscopic chiplets at a liquid-liquid-solid interface forming a 
      flexible segmented monocrystalline solar cell.
PG  - 993-8
LID - 10.1073/pnas.0909482107 [doi]
AB  - This paper introduces a method for self-assembling and electrically connecting small 
      (20-60 micrometer) semiconductor chiplets at predetermined locations on flexible 
      substrates with high speed (62500 chips/45 s), accuracy (0.9 micrometer, 0.14 
      degrees), and yield (> 98%). The process takes place at the triple interface between 
      silicone oil, water, and a penetrating solder-patterned substrate. The assembly is 
      driven by a stepwise reduction of interfacial free energy where chips are first 
      collected and preoriented at an oil-water interface before they assemble on a 
      solder-patterned substrate that is pulled through the interface. Patterned transfer 
      occurs in a progressing linear front as the liquid layers recede. The process 
      eliminates the dependency on gravity and sedimentation of prior methods, thereby 
      extending the minimal chip size to the sub-100 micrometer scale. It provides a new 
      route for the field of printable electronics to enable the integration of 
      microscopic high performance inorganic semiconductors on foreign substrates with the 
      freedom to choose target location, pitch, and integration density. As an example we 
      demonstrate a fault-tolerant segmented flexible monocrystalline silicon solar cell, 
      reducing the amount of Si that is used when compared to conventional rigid cells.

TI  - Spatially resolved U(VI) partitioning and speciation: implications for plume scale 
      behavior of contaminant U in the Hanford vadose zone.
PG  - 2247-53
AB  - A saline-alkaline brine containing high concentration of U(VI) was accidentally 
      spilled at the Hanford Site in 1951, introducing 10 tons of U into sediments under 
      storage tank BX-102. U concentrations in the deep vadose zone and groundwater plumes 
      increase with time, yet how the U has been migrating is not fully understood. We 
      simulated the spill event in laboratory soil columns, followed by aging, and 
      obtained spatially resolved U partitioning and speciation along simulated plumes. We 
      found after aging, at apparent steady state, that the pore aqueous phase U 
      concentrations remained surprisingly high (up to 0.022 M), in close agreement with 
      the recently reported high U concentrations (up to 0.027 M) in the vadose zone plume 
      (1). The pH values of aged pore liquids varying from 10 to 7, consistent with the 
      measured pH of the field borehole sediments varying from 9.5 to 7.4 (2), from near 
      the plume source to the plume front. The direct measurements of aged pore liquids 
      together with thermodynamic calculations using a Pitzer approach revealed that 
      UO2(CO3)3(4-) is the dominant aqueous U species within the plume body (pH 8-10), 
      whereas Ca2UO2(CO3)3 and CaUO2(CO3)32- are also significant in the plume 
      frontvicinity (pH 7-8), consistent with that measured from field borehole 
      pore-waters (3). U solid phase speciation varies at different locations along the 
      plume flow path and even within single sediment grains, because of location 
      dependent pore and micropore solution chemistry. Our results suggest that continuous 
      gravity-driven migration of the highly stable U02(CO3)34 in the residual carbonate 
      and sodium rich tank waste solution is likely responsible for the detected growing U 
      concentrations in the vadose zone and groundwater.

TI  - Holographic optical tweezers for object manipulations at an air-liquid surface.
PG  - 6342-52
AB  - We investigate holographic optical tweezers manipulating micro-beads at a suspended 
      air-liquid interface. Axial confinement of the particles in the two-dimensional 
      interface is maintained by the interplay between surface tension and gravity. 
      Therefore, optical trapping of the micro-beads is possible even with a long distance 
      air objective. Efficient micro-circulation of the liquid can be induced by fast 
      rotating beads, driven by the orbital angular momentum transfer of incident 
      Laguerre-Gaussian (doughnut) laser modes. Our setup allows various ways of creating 
      a tailored dynamic flow of particles and liquid within the surface. We demonstrate 
      examples of surface manipulations like efficient vortex pumps and mixers, 
      interactive particle flow steering by arrays of vortex pumps, the feasibility of 
      achieving a "clocked" traffic of micro beads, and size-selective guiding of beads 
      along optical "conveyor belts".

AB  - Chemical reaction in mixed convection magnetohydrodynamic second grade nanoliquid 
      thin film flow through a porous medium containing nanoparticles and gyrotactic 
      microorganisms is considered with entropy generation. The stratification phenomena, 
      heat and mass transfer simultaneously take place within system. Microorganisms are 
      utilized to stabilize the suspended nanoparticles through bioconvection. For the 
      chemical reaction of species, the mass transfer increases. The governing equations 
      of the problem are transformed to nonlinear differential equations through 
      similarity variables, which are solved through a well known scheme called homotopy 
      analysis method. The solution is expressed through graphs and illustrations which 
      show the influences of all the parameters. The residual error graphs elucidate the 
      authentication of the present work.

TI  - A rat lung model of instilled liquid transport in the pulmonary airways.
PG  - 1955-67
AB  - When a liquid is instilled in the pulmonary airways during medical therapy, the 
      method of instillation affects the liquid distribution throughout the lung. To 
      investigate the fluid transport dynamics, exogenous surfactant (Survanta) mixed with 
      a radiopaque tracer is instilled into tracheae of vertical, excised rat lungs 
      (ventilation 40 breaths/min, 4 ml tidal volume). Two methods are compared: For case 
      A, the liquid drains by gravity into the upper airways followed by inspiration; for 
      case B, the liquid initially forms a plug in the trachea, followed by inspiration. 
      Experiments are continuously recorded using a microfocal X-ray source and an 
      image-intensifier, charge-coupled device image train. Video images recorded at 30 
      images/s are digitized and analyzed. Transport dynamics during the first few breaths 
      are quantified statistically and follow trends for liquid plug propagation theory. A 
      plug of liquid driven by forced air can reach alveolar regions within the first few 
      breaths. Homogeneity of distribution measured at end inspiration for several breaths 
      demonstrates that case B is twice as homogeneous as case A. The formation of a 
      liquid plug in the trachea, before inspiration, is important in creating a more 
      uniform liquid distribution throughout the lungs.

TI  - The μPIVOT: an integrated particle image velocimeter and optical tweezers instrument 
      for microenvironment investigations.
PG  - 95403
AB  - A novel instrument to manipulate and characterize the mechanical environment in and 
      around microscale objects in a fluidic environment has been developed by integrating 
      two laser-based techniques: micron-resolution particle image velocimetry (μPIV) and 
      optical tweezers (OT). This instrument, the μPIVOT, enables a new realm of 
      microscale studies, yet still maintains the individual capabilities of each optical 
      technique. This was demonstrated with individual measurements of optical trap 
      stiffness (∼70 pN μm(-1) for a 20 μm polystyrene sphere and a linear relationship 
      between trap stiffness and laser power) and fluid velocities within 436 nm of a 
      microchannel wall. The integrated device was validated by comparing computational 
      flow predictions to the measured velocity profile around a trapped particle in 
      either a uniform flow or an imposed, gravity-driven microchannel flow (R(2) = 0.988, 
      RMS error = 13.04 μm s(-1)). Interaction between both techniques is shown to be 
      negligible for 15 μm to 35 μm diameter trapped particles subjected to fluid 
      velocities from 50 μm s(-1) to 500 μm s(-1) even at the highest laser power (1.45 
      W). The integrated techniques will provide a unique perspective toward understanding 
      microscale phenomena including single-cell biomechanics, non-Newtonian fluid 
      mechanics and single particle or particle-particle hydrodynamics.

TI  - Postural control in the lamprey: A study with a neuro-mechanical model.
PG  - 2880-7
AB  - The swimming lamprey normally maintains the dorsal-side-up orientation due to 
      activity of the postural control system driven by vestibular organs. Commands for 
      postural corrections are transmitted from the brain stem to the spinal cord mainly 
      by the reticulospinal (RS) pathways. As shown in previous studies, RS neurons are 
      activated by contralateral roll tilt, they exhibit a strong dynamic response, but 
      much weaker static response. Here we test a hypothesis that decoding of these 
      commands in the spinal cord is based on the subtraction of signals in the left and 
      right RS pathways. In this study, we used a neuro-mechanical model. An intact 
      lamprey was mounted on a platform that restrained its postural activity but allowed 
      lateral locomotor undulations to occur. The activity in the left and right RS 
      pathways was recorded by implanted electrodes. These natural biological signals were 
      then used to control an electrical motor rotating the animal around its longitudinal 
      axis toward the stronger signal. It was found that this "hybrid" system 
      automatically stabilized a normal orientation of the lamprey in the gravitational 
      field. The system compensated for large postural disturbances (lateral tilt up to 
      +/-180 degrees ) due to wide angular zones of the gravitational sensitivity of RS 
      neurons. In the nonswimming lamprey, activity of RS neurons and their vestibular 
      responses were considerably reduced, and the system was not able to stabilize the 
      normal orientation. However, the balance could be restored by imposing small 
      oscillations on the lamprey, which elicited additional activation of the vestibular 
      organs. This finding indicates that head oscillations caused by locomotor movements 
      may contribute to postural stabilization. In addition to postural stabilization, the 
      neuro-mechanical model reproduced a number of postural effects characteristic of the 
      lamprey: 1) unilateral eye illumination elicited a lateral tilt ("dorsal light 
      response") due to a shift of the equilibrium point in the vestibular-driven postural 
      network; 2) removal of one labyrinth resulted in a loss of postural control due to 
      an induced left-right asymmetry in the vestibulo-reticulospinal reflexes, which 3) 
      could be compensated for by asymmetrical visual input. The main conclusion of the 
      present study is that natural supraspinal commands for postural corrections in the 
      roll plane can be effectively decoded on the basis of subtraction of the effects of 
      signals delivered by the left and right RS pathways. Possible mechanisms for this 
      transformation are discussed.

TI  - Giant ringlike radio structures around galaxy cluster Abell 3376.
PG  - 791-4
AB  - In the current paradigm of cold dark matter cosmology, large-scale structures are 
      assembling through hierarchical clustering of matter. In this process, an important 
      role is played by megaparsec (Mpc)-scale cosmic shock waves, arising in 
      gravity-driven supersonic flows of intergalactic matter onto dark matter-dominated 
      collapsing structures such as pancakes, filaments, and clusters of galaxies. Here, 
      we report Very Large Array telescope observations of giant ( approximately 2 Mpc by 
      1.6 Mpc), ring-shaped nonthermal radio-emitting structures, found at the outskirts 
      of the rich cluster of galaxies Abell 3376. These structures may trace the elusive 
      shock waves of cosmological large-scale matter flows, which are energetic enough to 
      power them. These radio sources may also be the acceleration sites where magnetic 
      shocks are possibly boosting cosmic-ray particles with energies of up to 10(18) to 
      10(19) electron volts.

TI  - Stratospheric ozone over the United States in summer linked to observations of 
      convection and temperature via chlorine and bromine catalysis.
PG  - E4905-E4913
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1619318114 [doi]
AB  - We present observations defining (i) the frequency and depth of convective 
      penetration of water into the stratosphere over the United States in summer using 
      the Next-Generation Radar system; (ii) the altitude-dependent distribution of 
      inorganic chlorine established in the same coordinate system as the radar 
      observations; (iii) the high resolution temperature structure in the stratosphere 
      over the United States in summer that resolves spatial and structural variability, 
      including the impact of gravity waves; and (iv) the resulting amplification in the 
      catalytic loss rates of ozone for the dominant halogen, hydrogen, and nitrogen 
      catalytic cycles. The weather radar observations of ∼2,000 storms, on average, each 
      summer that reach the altitude of rapidly increasing available inorganic chlorine, 
      coupled with observed temperatures, portend a risk of initiating rapid heterogeneous 
      catalytic conversion of inorganic chlorine to free radical form on ubiquitous 
      sulfate-water aerosols; this, in turn, engages the element of risk associated with 
      ozone loss in the stratosphere over the central United States in summer based upon 
      the same reaction network that reduces stratospheric ozone over the Arctic. The 
      summertime development of the upper-level anticyclonic flow over the United States, 
      driven by the North American Monsoon, provides a means of retaining convectively 
      injected water, thereby extending the time for catalytic ozone loss over the Great 
      Plains. Trusted decadal forecasts of UV dosage over the United States in summer 
      require understanding the response of this dynamical and photochemical system to 
      increased forcing of the climate by increasing levels of CO(2) and CH(4).

TI  - Water rise kinetics in refilling xylem after desiccation in a resurrection plant.
PG  - 221-38
AB  - The acropetal water refilling kinetics of the dry xylem of branches (up to 80 cm 
      tall) of the resurrection plant Myrothamnus flabellifolia were determined with high 
      temporal resolution by observation of light refraction at the advancing water front 
      and the associated recurving of the folded leaves. To study the effect of gravity on 
      water rise, data were acquired for cut upright, horizontal and inverted branches. 
      Water rise kinetics were also determined with hydrostatic and osmotic pressure as 
      well as at elevated temperatures (up to 100 degrees C) under laboratory conditions 
      and compared with those obtained with intact (rooted) and cut branches under field 
      conditions. Experiments in which water climbed under its capillary pressure alone, 
      showed that the axial flow occurred only in a very few conducting elements at a much 
      higher rate than in many of the other ones. The onset of transpiration of the 
      unfolded and green leaves did not affect the rise kinetics in the 'prominent' 
      conducting elements. Application of pressure apparently increased the number of 
      elements making a major contribution to axial xylem flow. Analysis of these data in 
      terms of capillary-pressure-driven water ascent in leaky capillaries demonstrated 
      that root pressure, not capillary pressure, is the dominant force for rehydration of 
      rooted, dry plants. The main reasons for the failure of capillary forces in xylem 
      refilling were the small, rate-limiting effective radii of the conducting elements 
      for axial water ascent (c. 1 micrometer compared with radii of the vessels and 
      tracheids of c. 18 micrometers and 3 micrometers, respectively) and the very poor 
      wetting of the dry walls. The contact (wetting) angles were of the order of 80 
      degrees and decreased on root or externally applied hydrostatic pressure. This 
      supported our previous assumption that the inner walls of the dry conducting 
      elements are covered with a lipid layer that is removed or disintegrates upon 
      wetting. Consistent with this, potassium chloride and, particularly, sugars exerted 
      an osmotic pressure effect on axial water climbing (reflection coefficients > zero, 
      but small). Although the osmotically active solutes apparently suppressed radial 
      water spread through the tissue to the leaf cells, they reduced the axial water 
      ascent rather than accelerating it as predicted by the theory of capillary-driven 
      water rise in leaky capillaries. Killing cells by heat treatment and removal of the 
      bark, phelloderm, cortex and phloem also resulted in a reduction of the axial rise 
      rate and final height. These observations demonstrated that radial water movement 
      driven by the developing osmotic and turgor pressure in the living cells was 
      important for the removal of the lipid layer from the walls of those conducting 
      elements that were primarily not involved in water rise. There is some evidence from 
      field measurements of the axial temperature gradients along rooted branches that 
      interfacial (Marangoni) streaming facilitated lipid removal (under formation of 
      vesicle-like structures and lipid bodies) upon wetting. Grant numbers: 50WB 9643, Zi

TI  - Neutrino astronomy and gamma-ray bursts.
PG  - 1323-34
AB  - The construction of large-volume detectors of high energy, greater than 1TeV, 
      neutrinos is mainly driven by the search for extragalactic neutrino sources. The 
      existence of such sources is implied by the observations of ultra-high-energy, 
      greater than or equal to 1019eV, cosmic rays, the origin of which is a mystery. In 
      this lecture, I briefly discuss the expected extragalactic neutrino signal and the 
      current state of the experimental efforts. Neutrino emission from gamma-ray bursts 
      (GRBs), which are probably sources of both high-energy protons and neutrinos, is 
      discussed in some detail. The detection of the predicted GRB neutrino signal, which 
      may become possible in the coming few years, will allow one to identify the sources 
      of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays and to resolve open questions related to the 
      underlying physics of GRB models. Moreover, detection of GRB neutrinos will allow 
      one to test for neutrino properties (e.g. flavour oscillations and coupling to 
      gravity) with an accuracy many orders of magnitude better than is currently 
      possible.

TI  - Effects of inactivation of the anterior interpositus nucleus on the kinematic and 
      dynamic control of multijoint movement.
PG  - 1988-2000
AB  - We previously showed that inactivating the anterior interpositus nucleus in cats 
      disrupts prehension; paw paths, normally straight and accurate, become curved, 
      hypometric, and more variable. In the present study, we determined the joint 
      kinematic and dynamic origins of this impairment. Animals were restrained in a 
      hammock and trained to reach and grasp a cube of meat from a narrow food well at 
      varied heights; movements were monitored using the MacReflex analysis system. The 
      anterior interpositus nucleus was inactivated by microinjection of the GABA agonist 
      muscimol (0.25-0.5 microgram in 0.5 microliter saline). For each joint, we computed 
      the torque due to gravity, inertial resistance (termed self torque), interjoint 
      interactions (termed interaction torque), and the combined effects of active muscle 
      contraction and passive soft tissue stretch (termed generalized muscle torque). 
      Inactivation produced significant reductions in the amplitude, velocity, and 
      acceleration of elbow flexion. However, these movements continued to scale normally 
      with target height. Shoulder extension was reduced by inactivation but wrist angular 
      displacement and velocity were not. Inactivation also produced changes in the 
      temporal coordination between elbow, shoulder, and wrist kinematics. Dynamic 
      analysis showed that elbow flexion both before and during inactivation was produced 
      by the combined action of muscle and interaction torque, but that the timing 
      depended on muscle torque. Elbow interaction and muscle torques were scaled to 
      target height both before and during inactivation. Inactivation produced significant 
      reductions in elbow flexor interaction and muscle torques. The duration of elbow 
      flexor muscle torque was prolonged to compensate for the reduction in flexor 
      interaction torque. Shoulder extension was produced by extensor interaction and 
      muscle torques both before and during inactivation. Inactivation produced a 
      reduction in shoulder extension, primarily by reduced interaction torque, but 
      without compensation. Wrist plantarflexion, which occurred during elbow flexion, was 
      driven by plantarflexor interaction and gravitational torques both before and during 
      inactivation. Muscle torque acted in the opposite direction with a phase lead to 
      restrain the plantarflexor interaction torque. During inactivation, there was a 
      reduction in plantarflexor interaction torque and a loss of the phase lead of the 
      muscle torque. Our findings implicate the C1/C3 anterior interpositus zone of the 
      cerebellum in the anticipatory control of intersegmental dynamics during reaching, 
      which zone is required for coordinating the motions of the shoulder and wrist with 
      those of the elbow. In contrast, this cerebellar zone does not play a role in 
      scaling the movement to match a target.

AB  - Preconditions of phloem transport in conifers are relatively unknown. We studied the 
      variation of needle and inner bark axial osmotic gradients and xylem water potential 
      in Scots pine and Norway spruce by measuring needle and inner bark osmolality in 
      saplings and mature trees over several periods within a growing season. The needle 
      and inner bark osmolality was strongly related to xylem water potential in all 
      studied trees. Sugar concentrations were measured in Scots pine, and they had 
      similar dynamics to inner bark osmolality. The sucrose quantity remained fairly 
      constant over time and position, whereas the other sugars exhibited a larger change 
      with time and position. A small osmotic gradient existed from branch to stem base 
      under pre-dawn conditions, and the osmotic gradient between upper stem and stem base 
      was close to zero. The turgor in branches was significantly driven by xylem water 
      potential, and the turgor loss point in branches was relatively close to daily 
      minimum needle water potentials typically reported for Scots pine. Our results imply 
      that xylem water potential considerably impacts the turgor pressure gradient driving 
      phloem transport and that gravitation has a relatively large role in phloem 
      transport in the stems of mature Scots pine trees.

AB  - Plant functional traits capture important variation in plant strategy and function. 
      Recent literature has revealed that within-species variation in traits is greater 
      than previously supposed. However, we still have a poor understanding of how 
      intraspecific variation is coordinated among different traits, and how it is driven 
      by environment. We quantified intraspecific variation in wood density and five leaf 
      traits underpinning the leaf economics spectrum (leaf dry matter content, leaf mass 
      per unit area, size, thickness and density) within and among four widespread 
      Nothofagus tree species in southern New Zealand. We tested whether intraspecific 
      relationships between wood density and leaf traits followed widely reported 
      interspecific relationships, and whether variation in these traits was coordinated 
      through shared responses to environmental factors. Sample sites varied widely in 
      environmental variables, including soil fertility (25-900 mg kg(-1) total P), 
      precipitation (668-4875 mm yr(-1)), temperature (5.2-12.4 °C mean annual 
      temperature) and latitude (41-46 °S). Leaf traits were strongly correlated with one 
      another within species, but not with wood density. There was some evidence for a 
      positive relationship between wood density and leaf tissue density and dry matter 
      content, but no evidence that leaf mass or leaf size were correlated with wood 
      density; this highlights that leaf mass per unit area cannot be used as a surrogate 
      for component leaf traits such as tissue density. Trait variation was predicted by 
      environmental factors, but not consistently among different traits; e.g., only leaf 
      thickness and leaf density responded to the same environmental cues as wood density. 
      We conclude that although intraspecific variation in wood density and leaf traits is 
      strongly driven by environmental factors, these responses are not strongly 
      coordinated among functional traits even across co-occurring, closely-related plant 
      species.

TI  - Like a rolling stone: naturalistic visual kinematics facilitate tracking eye 
      movements.
PG  - 9
LID - 10.1167/13.2.9 [doi]
AB  - Newtonian physics constrains object kinematics in the real world. We asked whether 
      eye movements towards tracked objects depend on their compliance with those 
      constraints. In particular, the force of gravity constrains round objects to roll on 
      the ground with a particular rotational and translational motion. We measured 
      tracking eye movements towards rolling objects. We found that objects with 
      rotational and translational motion that was congruent with an object rolling on the 
      ground elicited faster tracking eye movements during pursuit initiation than 
      incongruent stimuli. Relative to a condition without rotational component, we 
      compared objects with this motion with a condition in which there was no rotational 
      component, we essentially obtained benefits of congruence, and, to a lesser extent, 
      costs from incongruence. Anticipatory pursuit responses showed no congruence effect, 
      suggesting that the effect is based on visually-driven predictions, not on velocity 
      storage. We suggest that the eye movement system incorporates information about 
      object kinematics acquired by a lifetime of experience with visual stimuli obeying 
      the laws of Newtonian physics.

TI  - Coupled mean flow-amplitude equations for nearly inviscid parametrically driven 
      surface waves.
PG  - 201-19
AB  - Nearly inviscid parametrically excited surface gravity-capillary waves in 
      two-dimensional periodic domains of finite depth and both small and large aspect 
      ratio are considered. Coupled equations describing the evolution of the amplitudes 
      of resonant left- and right-traveling waves and their interaction with a mean flow 
      in the bulk are derived, and the conditions for their validity established. In 
      general the mean flow consists of an inviscid part together with a viscous streaming 
      flow driven by a tangential stress due to an oscillating viscous boundary layer near 
      the free surface and a tangential velocity due to a bottom boundary layer. These 
      forcing mechanisms are important even in the limit of vanishing viscosity, and 
      provide boundary conditions for the Navier-Stokes equation satisfied by the mean 
      flow in the bulk. The streaming flow is responsible for several instabilities 
      leading to pattern drift.

TI  - Nonequilibrium phase transitions and a nonequilibrium critical point from anti-de 
      Sitter space and conformal field theory correspondence.
PG  - 120602
AB  - We find novel phase transitions and critical phenomena that occur only outside the 
      linear-response regime of current-driven nonequilibrium states. We consider the 
      strongly interacting (3+1)-dimensional N = 4 large-N(c) SU(N(c)) supersymmetric 
      Yang-Mills theory with a single flavor of fundamental N = 2 hypermultiplet as a 
      microscopic theory. We compute its nonlinear nonballistic quark-charge conductivity 
      by using the AdS/CFT correspondence. We find that the system exhibits a novel 
      nonequilibrium first-order phase transition where the conductivity jumps and the 
      sign of the differential conductivity flips at finite current density. A 
      nonequilibrium critical point is discovered at the end point of the first-order 
      regime. We propose a nonequilibrium steady-state analogue of thermodynamic potential 
      in terms of the gravity-dual theory in order to define the transition point. 
      Nonequilibrium analogues of critical exponents are proposed as well. The critical 
      behavior of the conductivity is numerically confirmed on the basis of these 
      proposals. The present work provides a new example of nonequilibrium phase 
      transitions and nonequilibrium critical points.
